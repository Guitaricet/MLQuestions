682	Parametric statistics generally require interval or ratio data. An example of this type of data is age, income, height, and weight in which the values are continuous and the intervals between values have meaning. In contrast, nonparametric statistics are typically used on data that nominal or ordinal.
683	Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.
684	A second type of quantitative variable is called a continuous variable . This is a variable where the scale is continuous and not made up of discrete steps. For example, if playing a game of trivia, the length of time it takes a player to give an answer might be represented by a continuous variable.
685	The random (or precision) error for this data point is defined as the reading minus the average of readings, or -1.20 - (-1.42) = 0.22oC. Thus, the maximum absolute value of random error is 0.22oC. You can verify that the magnitude of the random error for any of the other data points is less than this.

708	In a 2-by-2 table with cells a, b, c, and d (see figure), the odds ratio is odds of the event in the exposure group (a/b) divided by the odds of the event in the control or non-exposure group (c/d). Thus the odds ratio is (a/b) / (c/d) which simplifies to ad/bc.
709	By reversing the words in the source sentence, the average distance between corresponding words in the source and target language is unchanged. However, the first few words in the source language are now very close to the first few words in the target language, so the problem's minimal time lag is greatly reduced.
710	The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is an estimator of out-of-sample prediction error and thereby relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models.

717	Use systematic sampling when there's low risk of data manipulation. Systematic sampling is the preferred method over simple random sampling when a study maintains a low risk of data manipulation.
718	Uniform quantization may lead to either slope overload distortion or Granular noise.  Thus we go for Non Uniform quantization because step size varies based on the message signal and it will be tracked with minimal amount of error.
719	The Sobel filter is used for edge detection. It works by calculating the gradient of image intensity at each pixel within the image.  The result shows how abruptly or smoothly the image changes at each pixel, and therefore how likely it is that that pixel represents an edge.
720	Precision for Binary Classification In an imbalanced classification problem with two classes, precision is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of true positives and false positives.

729	When dealing with Machine Learning models, it is usually recommended that you store them somewhere. At the private sector, you oftentimes train them and store them before production, while in research and for future model tuning it is a good idea to store them locally.
730	One of the simplest causal analysis methods involves asking yourself “why” five times. You start by identifying the problem. “My house is always disorganized.” Then, you ask yourself why that is the case. You create a chain of inquiry that offers insight about the core of the problem.
731	Network representation learning has been recently proposed as a new learning paradigm to embed network vertices into a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure, vertex content, and other side information.
732	The effect of Gaussian smoothing is to blur an image, in a similar fashion to the mean filter. The degree of smoothing is determined by the standard deviation of the Gaussian. (Larger standard deviation Gaussians, of course, require larger convolution kernels in order to be accurately represented.)
733	Quantization, in mathematics and digital signal processing, is the process of mapping input values from a large set (often a continuous set) to output values in a (countable) smaller set, often with a finite number of elements.

738	Amazon ML supports three types of ML models: binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression. The type of model you should choose depends on the type of target that you want to predict.
739	Yes, decoherence does solve the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. Decoherence explains why, after a measurement, you would get the same result if you immediately made the same measurement again.  So the claim being made is that decoherence explains why the wavefunction appears to collapse.
740	Quota Sampling also has its pros and cons. As this process sets criteria to choose samples, disadvantages are mainly due to its non-random nature. Some of the disadvantages are as follows: Since quota sampling is a non-random sampling method, it is impossible to find the sampling error.
741	Feature detection is a low-level image processing operation. That is, it is usually performed as the first operation on an image, and examines every pixel to see if there is a feature present at that pixel.
742	A true positive is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class. Similarly, a true negative is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class. A false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.

820	Latent Semantic Analysis is a technique for creating a vector representation of a document.  This in turn means you can do handy things like classifying documents to determine which of a set of known topics they most likely belong to.
821	Probability is about a finite set of possible outcomes, given a probability. Likelihood is about an infinite set of possible probabilities, given an outcome.
822	If the outcomes are mutually independent, then yes the method is valid. If the outcomes are mutually exclusive, then no, the method is not valid. It's easy to see why this is the case. If you have three binary models, then the sum of the outcomes do not necessarily sum to one.
823	In statistics, a negatively skewed (also known as left-skewed) distribution is a type of distribution in which more values are concentrated on the right side (tail) of the distribution graph while the left tail of the distribution graph is longer.
824	Kappa is widely used on Twitch in chats to signal you are being sarcastic or ironic, are trolling, or otherwise playing around with someone. It is usually typed at the end of a string of text, but, as can often the case on Twitch, it is also often used on its own or repeatedly (to spam someone).
825	Although many types of neural network models have been developed to solve different problems, the most widely used model by far for time series forecasting has been the feedforward neural network.
826	You calculate the mean, say it's 10. You calculate the standard deviation: it's 12. That means that any number from 10 to 22 is within one standard deviation away from the mean. Now if your data are symmetric (say normal), any number from -2 to 10 is also within a standard deviation from the mean.
827	The pdf represents the relative frequency of failure times as a function of time. The cdf is a function, F(x)\,\!, of a random variable X\,\!, and is defined for a number x\,\!
828	Word2vec being log-linear means we calculate the gradient at the output and then directly propagate this back into the embedding parameters (the main computational burden during training). This means faster trainer over bigger datasets yielding more accurate embedding vectors.
829	K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm as it infers a clustering (or labels) for a set of provided samples that do not initially have labels. The goal of k-means is to partition the n samples from your dataset in to k clusters where each datapoint belongs to the single cluster for which it is nearest to.
830	Abnormal BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are found in 5% to 10% of all breast cancer cases in the United States. A study found that women with an abnormal BRCA1 gene had a worse prognosis than women with an abnormal BRCA2 gene 5 years after diagnosis.
831	Random sampling ensures that results obtained from your sample should approximate what would have been obtained if the entire population had been measured (Shadish et al., 2002). The simplest random sample allows all the units in the population to have an equal chance of being selected.
832	Cohen's kappa.  Cohen suggested the Kappa result be interpreted as follows: values ≤ 0 as indicating no agreement and 0.01–0.20 as none to slight, 0.21–0.40 as fair, 0.41– 0.60 as moderate, 0.61–0.80 as substantial, and 0.81–1.00 as almost perfect agreement.
833	You can tell if two random variables are independent by looking at their individual probabilities. If those probabilities don't change when the events meet, then those variables are independent. Another way of saying this is that if the two variables are correlated, then they are not independent.
834	Most deep learning methods use neural network architectures, which is why deep learning models are often referred to as deep neural networks.  A CNN convolves learned features with input data, and uses 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such as images.
835	Random assignment is however a process of randomly assigning subjects to experimental or control groups. This is a standard practice in true experimental research to ensure that treatment groups are similar (equivalent) to each other and to the control group, prior to treatment administration.
836	Stratified random sampling involves first dividing a population into subpopulations and then applying random sampling methods to each subpopulation to form a test group. A disadvantage is when researchers can't classify every member of the population into a subgroup.
837	Decision Trees in Machine Learning. Decision Tree models are created using 2 steps: Induction and Pruning. Induction is where we actually build the tree i.e set all of the hierarchical decision boundaries based on our data. Because of the nature of training decision trees they can be prone to major overfitting.
838	There are two types of probability distribution which are used for different purposes and various types of the data generation process. Let us discuss now both the types along with its definition, formula and examples.
839	Regression is mainly used in order to make estimates or predictions for the dependent variable with the help of single or multiple independent variables, and ANOVA is used to find a common mean between variables of different groups.
840	A critical value of z (Z-score) is used when the sampling distribution is normal, or close to normal. Z-scores are used when the population standard deviation is known or when you have larger sample sizes.  See also: T Critical Value.
841	Another cause of skewness is start-up effects. For example, if a procedure initially has a lot of successes during a long start-up period, this could create a positive skew on the data. (On the opposite hand, a start-up period with several initial failures can negatively skew data.)
842	In cluster sampling, researchers divide a population into smaller groups known as clusters. They then randomly select among these clusters to form a sample. Cluster sampling is a method of probability sampling that is often used to study large populations, particularly those that are widely geographically dispersed.

847	K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970's as a non-parametric technique.
848	The ability to detect certain types of stimuli, like movements, shape, and angles, requires specialized cells in the brain called feature detectors. Without these, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to detect a round object, like a baseball, hurdling toward you at 90 miles per hour.
849	Downsampling an image When data is removed the image also degrades to some extent, although not nearly as much as when you upsample. By removing this extra data ( downsampling) this results in a much smaller file size. For example, you can see below that our original image was 17.2 MB at 3000 by 2000 pixels.
850	Parametric statistics are based on assumptions about the distribution of population from which the sample was taken. Nonparametric statistics are not based on assumptions, that is, the data can be collected from a sample that does not follow a specific distribution.
851	A sampling frame is a list or map that identifies most units within the target population.  When evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of any sampling frame for qualitative research, it is important, as with quantitative research, to consider whether the frame is comprehensive.
852	The degrees of freedom for the chi-square are calculated using the following formula: df = (r-1)(c-1) where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. If the observed chi-square test statistic is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis can be rejected.
853	Optimal control focuses on a subset of problems, but solves these problems very well, and has a rich history. RL can be thought of as a way of generalizing or extending ideas from optimal control to non-traditional control problems.
854	A pooling layer is another building block of a CNN. Its function is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network. Pooling layer operates on each feature map independently. The most common approach used in pooling is max pooling.
855	Data are skewed right when most of the data are on the left side of the graph and the long skinny tail extends to the right. Data are skewed left when most of the data are on the right side of the graph and the long skinny tail extends to the left.

857	Detection theory or signal detection theory is a means to measure the ability to differentiate between information-bearing patterns (called stimulus in living organisms, signal in machines) and random patterns that distract from the information (called noise, consisting of background stimuli and random activity of the
858	"Gradient boosting is a technique for building an ensemble of weak models such that the predictions of the ensemble minimize a loss function.  Gradient descent ""descends"" the gradient by introducing changes to parameters, whereas gradient boosting descends the gradient by introducing new models."
859	KNN works by finding the distances between a query and all the examples in the data, selecting the specified number examples (K) closest to the query, then votes for the most frequent label (in the case of classification) or averages the labels (in the case of regression).
860	Perhaps the most famous case ever of misleading statistics in the news is the case of Sally Clark, who was convicted of murdering her children. She was freed after it was found the statistics used in her murder trial were completely wrong.
861	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Image segmentation with CNN involves feeding segments of an image as input to a convolutional neural network, which labels the pixels. The CNN cannot process the whole image at once.
862	Define hypotheses.  The test statistic is a z-score (z) defined by the following equation. z = (x - M ) / [ σ /sqrt(n) ] where x is the observed sample mean, M is the hypothesized population mean (from the null hypothesis), and σ is the standard deviation of the population.
863	Definition : A random experiment is an experiment or a process for which the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. Definition : The sample space (denoted S) of a random experiment is the set of all possible outcomes.
864	Word2Vec takes texts as training data for a neural network. The resulting embedding captures whether words appear in similar contexts. GloVe focuses on words co-occurrences over the whole corpus. Its embeddings relate to the probabilities that two words appear together.
865	The coefficients in a Cox regression relate to hazard; a positive coefficient indicates a worse prognosis and a negative coefficient indicates a protective effect of the variable with which it is associated.
866	Boosting. Another general machine learning ensemble method is known as boosting. Boosting differs somewhat from bagging as it does not involve bootstrap sampling.
867	For omitted variable bias to occur, the following two conditions must exist:The omitted variable must correlate with the dependent variable.The omitted variable must correlate with at least one independent variable that is in the regression model.
868	There are four basic sequence learning problems: sequence prediction, sequence generation, sequence recognition, and sequential decision making. These “problems” show how sequences are formulated.
869	Signal Detection Theory assumes that, given this situation, we make our judgment of whether the signal is present, or not, by setting up a Criterion value, β (beta).  When a value is picked up that exceeds β, we respond that the signal is present.
870	ROC curves are frequently used to show in a graphical way the connection/trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off for a test or a combination of tests.  In addition, the area under the ROC curve gives an idea about the benefit of using the test(s) in question.
871	In an economic model, an exogenous variable is one whose value is determined outside the model and is imposed on the model, and an exogenous change is a change in an exogenous variable.  In contrast, an endogenous variable is a variable whose value is determined by the model.
872	"Eigenvalues and eigenvectors allow us to ""reduce"" a linear operation to separate, simpler, problems. For example, if a stress is applied to a ""plastic"" solid, the deformation can be dissected into ""principle directions""- those directions in which the deformation is greatest."
873	A little bit of coding skills is enough, but it's better to have knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and OOPs concept. Some of the popular programming languages to learn machine learning in are Python, R, Java, and C++.
874	Brief Description. The Fourier Transform is an important image processing tool which is used to decompose an image into its sine and cosine components. The output of the transformation represents the image in the Fourier or frequency domain, while the input image is the spatial domain equivalent.
875	Definition Quantile. A quantile defines a particular part of a data set, i.e. a quantile determines how many values in a distribution are above or below a certain limit. Special quantiles are the quartile (quarter), the quintile (fifth) and percentiles (hundredth).
876	Whereas the null hypothesis of the two-sample t test is equal means, the null hypothesis of the Wilcoxon test is usually taken as equal medians. Another way to think of the null is that the two populations have the same distribution with the same median.
877	The conditional probability can be calculated using the joint probability, although it would be intractable. Bayes Theorem provides a principled way for calculating the conditional probability. The simple form of the calculation for Bayes Theorem is as follows: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

879	When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots.  Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex.
880	The one-sample Z test is used only for tests of the sample mean. Thus, our hypothesis tests whether the average of our sample (M) suggests that our students come from a population with a know mean (m) or whether it comes from a different population.

883	Since most natural phenomena are complex and have many factors, the same logic as above applies and distribution of measures of such phenomena tend to have most values near the mean (normal distibution has a desirable property of mean and mode being the same - i.e. the mean is the same as the most frequent value).
884	In reinforcement learning, the output depends on the state of current input and the output of the next state depends on the out of the previous output. Whereas in supervised learning, the decision made is based only on the current input. It uses labeled data sets to make decisions.

897	Cluster analysis, or clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning task. It involves automatically discovering natural grouping in data. Unlike supervised learning (like predictive modeling), clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space.
898	The (BIG) Z is a similar to the small z for one very good reason: It is a standard score. The z score has the sample standard deviation as the denominator, whereas the z-test value has the standard error of the mean ( or a measure of the variability of all the means from the population) as the dominator.

904	An S-curve is simply a curve of some object, line or path in the image that curves back and forth horizontally as you proceed vertically, much like the letter S–in fact, usually exactly like the letter S.
905	This type of index is called an inverted index, namely because it is an inversion of the forward index.  In some search engines the index includes additional information such as frequency of the terms, e.g. how often a term occurs in each document, or the position of the term in each document.
906	Weighted kNN is a modified version of k nearest neighbors.  The simplest method is to take the majority vote, but this can be a problem if the nearest neighbors vary widely in their distance and the closest neighbors more reliably indicate the class of the object.
907	Gravity tries to keep things together through attraction and thus tends to lower statistical entropy. The universal law of increasing entropy (2nd law of thermodynamics) states that the entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase with time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium.

Avoid leading questions.  Avoid or break down difficult concepts.  Use interval questions.  Keep the time period short and relevant.
933	The ability to slide the signal is the what gives Engineers a more accurate representation of the signal and therefore a better resolution in time.  So when you use a Wavelet Transform the signal is deconstructed using the same wavelet at different scales, rather than the same sin() wave at different frequencies.
934	In regression analysis, the dependent variable is denoted Y and the independent variable is denoted X. So, in this case, Y=total cholesterol and X=BMI. When there is a single continuous dependent variable and a single independent variable, the analysis is called a simple linear regression analysis .

1232	The null hypothesis is a general statement that states that there is no relationship between two phenomenons under consideration or that there is no association between two groups. An alternative hypothesis is a statement that describes that there is a relationship between two selected variables in a study.
1233	Verify that the partial derivative Fxy is correct by calculating its equivalent, Fyx, taking the derivatives in the opposite order (d/dy first, then d/dx). In the above example, the derivative d/dy of the function f(x,y) = 3x^2*y - 2xy is 3x^2 - 2x.
1234	A regression equation is used in stats to find out what relationship, if any, exists between sets of data.

1250	The mean squared error tells you how close a regression line is to a set of points. It does this by taking the distances from the points to the regression line (these distances are the “errors”) and squaring them. The squaring is necessary to remove any negative signs. It also gives more weight to larger differences.
1251	The main reason why we use sigmoid function is because it exists between (0 to 1). Therefore, it is especially used for models where we have to predict the probability as an output. Since probability of anything exists only between the range of 0 and 1, sigmoid is the right choice. The function is differentiable.
1252	k in kNN algorithm represents the number of nearest neighbor points which are voting for the new test data's class. If k=1, then test examples are given the same label as the closest example in the training set.
1253	The short answer is: Logistic regression is considered a generalized linear model because the outcome always depends on the sum of the inputs and parameters. Or in other words, the output cannot depend on the product (or quotient, etc.)
1254	A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary (“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”).  It can also tell you if your data is symmetrical, how tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data is skewed.

1256	Logistic regression is a powerful machine learning algorithm that utilizes a sigmoid function and works best on binary classification problems, although it can be used on multi-class classification problems through the “one vs. all” method. Logistic regression (despite its name) is not fit for regression tasks.
1257	The main difference between the two types of models is that path analysis assumes that all variables are measured without error. SEM uses latent variables to account for measurement error.

Use K-fold Cross-Validation in the right way.  Ensemble different resampled datasets.  Resample with different ratios.  Cluster the abundant class.  Design your own models.
1503	A statistic T = r(X1,X2,··· ,Xn) is a sufficient statistic if for each t, the conditional distribution of X1,X2, ···,Xn given T = t and θ does not depend on θ.
1504	In this article, we'll cover some of the frameworks set around deep learning and neural networks, including:TensorFlow.Keras.PyTorch.Theano.DL4J.Caffe.Chainer.Microsoft CNTK.
1505	One-class SVM is an unsupervised algorithm that learns a decision function for novelty detection: classifying new data as similar or different to the training set.
1506	Normal Approximation to the Binomialn is your sample size,p is your given probability.q is just 1 – p. For example, let's say your probability p is . You would find q by subtracting this probability from 1: q = 1 – . 6 = .
1507	Cluster analysis, or clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning task. It involves automatically discovering natural grouping in data. Unlike supervised learning (like predictive modeling), clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space.
1508	The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance.  The average deviation, also called the mean absolute deviation , is another measure of variability. However, average deviation utilizes absolute values instead of squares to circumvent the issue of negative differences between data and the mean.
1509	In medical diagnosis, test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate).
1510	The pre-attention phase is an automatic process which happens unconsciously. The second stage is focused attention in which an individual takes all of the observed features and combines them to make a complete perception. This second stage process occurs if the object doesn't stand out immediately.
1511	Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself.
1512	Bias is calculated as the product of two components: non-response rate and the difference between the observed and non-respondent answers. Increasing either of the two components will lead to an increase in bias.
1513	One is that larger learning rates increase the noise on the stochastic gradient, which acts as an implicit regularizer.  If you find your model overfitting with a low learning rate, the minima you're falling into might actually be too sharp and cause the model to generalize poorly.
1514	"q is called the variational approximation to the posterior. The term variational is used because you pick the best q in Q -- the term derives from the ""calculus of variations,"" which deals with optimization problems that pick the best function (in this case, a distribution q)."
1515	Essentially, multivariate analysis is a tool to find patterns and relationships between several variables simultaneously. It lets us predict the effect a change in one variable will have on other variables.  Multivariate analysis is also highly graphical in its approach.
1516	The main difference between DevOps and SRE is that SRE is more operationally driven from the top-down, and it's governed by the developer or development team, instead of the operations team.
1517	Tokenization breaks the raw text into words, sentences called tokens. These tokens help in understanding the context or developing the model for the NLP. The tokenization helps in interpreting the meaning of the text by analyzing the sequence of the words.  Tokenization can be done to either separate words or sentences.
1518	Parameters are like exogenous variables in that their values are taken as given. They are distinct, however, from exogenous variables in that they tend to represent things that are given by nature such as consumer preferences or production technologies.
1519	The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is an algorithm used to detect and describe local features in digital images.  The descriptors are supposed to be invariant against various transformations which might make images look different although they represent the same object(s).
1520	An affine function is the composition of a linear function with a translation, so while the linear part fixes the origin, the translation can map it somewhere else.  While affine functions don't preserve the origin, they do preserve some of the other geometry of the space, such as the collection of straight lines.
1521	"The obvious difference between ANOVA and ANCOVA is the the letter ""C"", which stands for 'covariance'. Like ANOVA, ""Analysis of Covariance"" (ANCOVA) has a single continuous response variable. ANCOVA is also commonly used to describe analyses with a single response variable, continuous IVs, and no factors."
1522	Class boundaries are values halfway between the upper class limit of one class and the lower class limit of the next. Class limits specify the span of data values that fall within a class.
1523	Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel. This is related to a form of mathematical convolution. The matrix operation being performed—convolution—is not traditional matrix multiplication, despite being similarly denoted by *.
1524	Creating the Regression LineDEFINITIONS:b1 - This is the SLOPE of the regression line.  b0 - This is the intercept of the regression line with the y-axis.  Y-hat = b0 + b1(x) - This is the sample regression line.
1525	Experience replay is the fundamental data generating mech- anism in off-policy deep reinforcement learning (Lin, 1992). It has been shown to improve sample efficiency and stability. by storing a fixed number of the most recently collected. transitions for training.
1526	Hidden Markov models have been around for a pretty long time (1970s at least). It's a misnomer to call them machine learning algorithms.  It is most useful, IMO, for state sequence estimation, which is not a machine learning problem since it is for a dynamical process, not a static classification task.
1527	Fisher's exact test is a statistical test used to determine if there are nonrandom associations between two categorical variables. . For each one, calculate the associated conditional probability using (2), where the sum of these probabilities must be 1.

1529	In Bayesian statistics, a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate is an estimate of an unknown quantity, that equals the mode of the posterior distribution. The MAP can be used to obtain a point estimate of an unobserved quantity on the basis of empirical data.
1530	The major factor affects standard error of the mean is sample size. The size of the sample increases the standard error of the mean decreases. Another factor affecting the standard error of the mean is the size of the population standard deviation.
1531	Exponential smoothing is a way to smooth out data for presentations or to make forecasts. It's usually used for finance and economics. If you have a time series with a clear pattern, you could use moving averages — but if you don't have a clear pattern you can use exponential smoothing to forecast.

1533	A simple random sample is similar to a random sample. The difference between the two is that with a simple random sample, each object in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. With random sampling, each object does not necessarily have an equal chance of being chosen.
1534	A true positive is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class. Similarly, a true negative is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class. A false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.
1535	Splitting: Dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes based on if-else conditions. Decision Node: After splitting the sub-nodes into further sub-nodes, then it is called as the decision node. Leaf or Terminal Node: This is the end of the decision tree where it cannot be split into further sub-nodes.
1536	To calculate the mean of grouped data, the first step is to determine the midpoint (also called a class mark) of each interval, or class. These midpoints must then be multiplied by the frequencies of the corresponding classes. The sum of the products divided by the total number of values will be the value of the mean.
1537	In regression analysis, you need to standardize the independent variables when your model contains polynomial terms to model curvature or interaction terms.  This problem can obscure the statistical significance of model terms, produce imprecise coefficients, and make it more difficult to choose the correct model.
1538	The power of AI and robotics combined In theory, if you combine AI and a robot, you get an artificially intelligent robot with a high level of autonomy, able to optimize tasks it is assigned to do and “learn”. In this case, AI serves as the “brain” of the robot, while the sensors and mechanical parts act as the “body”.
1539	These represent the squares of the deviation from the mean for each measured value of data. Add the squares of errors together. The final step is to find the sum of the values in the third column. The desired result is the SSE, or the sum of squared errors.
1540	I guess if you squint at it sideways, binary search is greedy in the sense that you're trying to cut down your search space by as much as you can in each step. It just happens to be a greedy algorithm in a search space with structure making that both efficient, and always likely to find the right answer.

1543	Bayesian inference refers to statistical inference where uncertainty in inferences is quantified using probability.  Statistical models specify a set of statistical assumptions and processes that represent how the sample data is generated. Statistical models have a number of parameters that can be modified.
1544	Bias is a disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing, usually in a way that is closed-minded, prejudicial, or unfair. Biases can be innate or learned. People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief. In science and engineering, a bias is a systematic error.
1545	The bootstrap method is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. It can be used to estimate summary statistics such as the mean or standard deviation.
1546	AdaBoost is short for Adaptive Boosting and is a very popular boosting technique which combines multiple “weak classifiers” into a single “strong classifier”. It was formulated by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire. They also won the 2003 Gödel Prize for their work.
1547	Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. In reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation.  Its goal is to maximize the total reward.
1548	"The classic example of experimenter bias is that of ""Clever Hans"", an Orlov Trotter horse claimed by his owner von Osten to be able to do arithmetic and other tasks."
1549	"My main criticism of Bayes' Theorem is that it is stating the obvious, and much like the ""Law of Large Numbers"" (which essentially states that N * x = N*x = Nx) doesn't deserve to have a name."
1550	So there are exactly n vectors in every basis for Rn . By definition, the four column vectors of A span the column space of A. The third and fourth column vectors are dependent on the first and second, and the first two columns are independent. Therefore, the first two column vectors are the pivot columns.
1551	Autocorrelation can cause problems in conventional analyses (such as ordinary least squares regression) that assume independence of observations. In a regression analysis, autocorrelation of the regression residuals can also occur if the model is incorrectly specified.
1552	Autoregression is a time series model that uses observations from previous time steps as input to a regression equation to predict the value at the next time step. It is a very simple idea that can result in accurate forecasts on a range of time series problems.
1553	Categorical variables require special attention in regression analysis because, unlike dichotomous or continuous variables, they cannot by entered into the regression equation just as they are. Instead, they need to be recoded into a series of variables which can then be entered into the regression model.
1554	The independence between inputs means that each input has a different normalization operation, allowing arbitrary mini-batch sizes to be used. The experimental results show that layer normalization performs well for recurrent neural networks.
1555	Residual analysis is used to assess the appropriateness of a linear regression model by defining residuals and examining the residual plot graphs.
1556	The probability that a standard normal random variables lies between two values is also easy to find. The P(a < Z < b) = P(Z < b) - P(Z < a). For example, suppose we want to know the probability that a z-score will be greater than -1.40 and less than -1.20.
1557	Linear regression is used to find the best fitting line between all the points of your dataset (by computing the minimum of a given distance), it does not, in itself, reduce the dimensionality of your data.
1558	Likelihood ratios (LR) in medical testing are used to interpret diagnostic tests. Basically, the LR tells you how likely a patient has a disease or condition. The higher the ratio, the more likely they have the disease or condition. Conversely, a low ratio means that they very likely do not.
1559	The geometric distribution is a special case of the negative binomial distribution. It deals with the number of trials required for a single success. Thus, the geometric distribution is a negative binomial distribution where the number of successes (r) is equal to 1.
1560	Heterogeneity in statistics means that your populations, samples or results are different. It is the opposite of homogeneity, which means that the population/data/results are the same.
1561	Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
1562	Stratified random sampling is one common method that is used by researchers because it enables them to obtain a sample population that best represents the entire population being studied, making sure that each subgroup of interest is represented. All the same, this method of research is not without its disadvantages.

1565	Partially inspired by neuroscience, CNN shares many properties with the visual system of the brain.  A prominent difference is that CNN is typically a feed-forward architecture while in the visual system recurrent connections are abundant.
1566	"= P(A)^P(B) which is just the probability of A times the probability of B. If they are dependent, then P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B|A) which is the probability of A times the probability of ""B happening if A has occurred,"" which is different than the ""Probability of B if A has not occurred."""
1567	Use the formula (zy)i = (yi – ȳ) / s y and calculate a standardized value for each yi. Add the products from the last step together. Divide the sum from the previous step by n – 1, where n is the total number of points in our set of paired data. The result of all of this is the correlation coefficient r.
1568	Summary: Chaos theory is a mathematical theory that can be used to explain complex systems such as weather, astronomy, politics, and economics. Although many complex systems appear to behave in a random manner, chaos theory shows that, in reality, there is an underlying order that is difficult to see.
1569	Formally, a statistic T(X1,···,Xn) is said to be sufficient for θ if the conditional distribution of X1,···,Xn, given T = t, does not depend on θ for any value of t. In other words, given the value of T, we can gain no more knowledge about θ from knowing more about the probability distribution of X1,···,Xn.
1570	Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range. It is performed during the data pre-processing to handle highly varying magnitudes or values or units.  So, we use Feature Scaling to bring all values to same magnitudes and thus, tackle this issue.
1571	If a random variable is a discrete variable, its probability distribution is called a discrete probability distribution. An example will make this clear. Suppose you flip a coin two times.  The random variable X can only take on the values 0, 1, or 2, so it is a discrete random variable.
1572	Linear filtering of an image is accomplished through an operation called convolution. Convolution is a neighborhood operation in which each output pixel is the weighted sum of neighboring input pixels. The matrix of weights is called the convolution kernel, also known as the filter.

Measures of central tendency include the mean, median and mode, while measures of variability include standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum variables, and kurtosis and skewness.
1574	Stream processing is the processing of data in motion, or in other words, computing on data directly as it is produced or received. The majority of data are born as continuous streams: sensor events, user activity on a website, financial trades, and so on – all these data are created as a series of events over time.
1575	The original AlphaGo demonstrated superhuman Go-playing ability, but needed the expertise of human players to get there. Namely, it used a dataset of more than 100,000 Go games as a starting point for its own knowledge. AlphaGo Zero, by comparison, has only been programmed with the basic rules of Go.
1576	Random assignment helps reduce the chances of systematic differences between the groups at the start of an experiment and, thereby, mitigates the threats of confounding variables and alternative explanations. However, the process does not always equalize all of the confounding variables.
1577	Multitasking is the display of strengths and positive attributes in a multiple number of ways at the same time.  Time is money, and so multitasking will help you carry out more tasks and be more competitive. Remember to keep multitasking to a limit you can handle, to ensure focus is maximised in the tasks you carry out.

1585	Linear models, generalized linear models, and nonlinear models are examples of parametric regression models because we know the function that describes the relationship between the response and explanatory variables.  If the relationship is unknown and nonlinear, nonparametric regression models should be used.
1586	The usual logic of 2SLS doesn't work the same way for logit, since the underlying regression equations are latent (you only observe a categorical indicator instead of the underlying, interval-scaled response).
1587	In layman terms, vectors have magnitude and direction and follow the laws of vector addition.  The only difference is that tensor is the generalized form of scalars and vectors . Means scalars and vectors are the special cases of tensor quantities. Scalar is a tensor of rank 0 and vector is a tensor of rank 1.

1608	A value of zero indicates that there is no relationship between the two variables. Correlation among variables does not (necessarily) imply causation.  If the correlation coefficient of two variables is zero, it signifies that there is no linear relationship between the variables.
1609	When faced with a choice, we often lack the time or resources to investigate in greater depth.

1638	The precision-recall curve shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for different threshold. A high area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a low false negative rate.
1639	Convergence is the ability to turn the two eyes inward toward each other to look at a close object. We depend on this visual skill for near-work activities such as desk work at school, working on a smartphone type device, or even in sports when catching a ball.

The most common example is a shirt that is available in different colors and sizes but they can be used for anything that is sold with different options. Matrix items provide benefits that simplifies the process for users and improves data accuracy.
1646	A z-score measures exactly how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is.  A negative z-score says the data point is below average. A z-score close to 0 says the data point is close to average. A data point can be considered unusual if its z-score is above 3 or below −3 .

1650	The p-value is not enough Therefore, a significant p-value tells us that an intervention works, whereas an effect size tells us how much it works. It can be argued that emphasizing the size of effect promotes a more scientific approach, as unlike significance tests, effect size is independent of sample size.
1651	Categorical variables require special attention in regression analysis because, unlike dichotomous or continuous variables, they cannot by entered into the regression equation just as they are. Instead, they need to be recoded into a series of variables which can then be entered into the regression model.

1747	By calculating the median value of a neighborhood rather than the mean filter, the median filter has two main advantages over the mean filter: The median is a more robust average than the mean and so a single very unrepresentative pixel in a neighborhood will not affect the median value significantly.
1748	The relationship between correlation coefficient and a scatterplot is that the two of them describe how similar the variables are.  A scatterplot that looks like a blobby thing without direction has a correlation coefficient closer to 0, meaning the two variables aren't correlated.

1770	The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.  The learning rate may be the most important hyperparameter when configuring your neural network.
1771	and the definition of unbiased estimator corresponds to the fact that the above integral should be equal to the parameter θ of the underlying distribution.  The sample mean and variance are consistent and unbiased esti- mators of the mean and variance of the underlying distribution.
1772	K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970's as a non-parametric technique.
1773	"Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to test differences between two or more means. It may seem odd that the technique is called ""Analysis of Variance"" rather than ""Analysis of Means."" As you will see, the name is appropriate because inferences about means are made by analyzing variance."
1774	7 Techniques to Handle Imbalanced DataUse the right evaluation metrics.  Resample the training set.  Use K-fold Cross-Validation in the right way.  Ensemble different resampled datasets.  Resample with different ratios.  Cluster the abundant class.  Design your own models.
1775	Continuous probability distribution: A probability distribution in which the random variable X can take on any value (is continuous). Because there are infinite values that X could assume, the probability of X taking on any one specific value is zero. Therefore we often speak in ranges of values (p(X>0) = . 50).
1776	The basic strength of inductive reasoning is its use in predicting what might happen in the future or in establishing the possibility of what you will encounter. The main weakness of inductive reasoning is that it is incomplete, and you may reach false conclusions even with accurate observations.

1779	Precision and recall at k: Definition Precision at k is the proportion of recommended items in the top-k set that are relevant. Its interpretation is as follows. Suppose that my precision at 10 in a top-10 recommendation problem is 80%. This means that 80% of the recommendation I make are relevant to the user.
1780	Noisy data is a data that has relatively signal-to-noise ratio.  This error is referred to as noise. Noise creates trouble for machine learning algorithms because if not trained properly, algorithms can think of noise to be a pattern and can start generalizing from it, which of course is undesirable.

1782	Answer: An independent variable is exactly what it sounds like. It is a variable that stands alone and isn't changed by the other variables you are trying to measure. For example, someone's age might be an independent variable.
1783	An RBF is a function that changes with distance from a location. For example, suppose the radial basis function is simply the distance from each location, so it forms an inverted cone over each location. If you take a cross section of the x,z plane for y = 5, you will see a slice of each radial basis function.
1784	To do so, you can completely opt out from the automatic change detection in your component, and handle things yourself, by injecting in your component a ChangeDetectorRef . This class offers a few methods: detach() detectChanges()
1785	ANOVA is used to compare and contrast the means of two or more populations. ANCOVA is used to compare one variable in two or more populations while considering other variables.
1786	"Global (or Absolute) Maximum and Minimum The maximum or minimum over the entire function is called an ""Absolute"" or ""Global"" maximum or minimum. There is only one global maximum (and one global minimum) but there can be more than one local maximum or minimum.  The Global Minimum is −Infinity."
1787	A discrete variable is a variable which can only take a countable number of values. In this example, the number of heads can only take 4 values (0, 1, 2, 3) and so the variable is discrete. The variable is said to be random if the sum of the probabilities is one.
1788	If the data set follows the bias then Naive Bayes will be a better classifier. Both Naive Bayes and Logistic regression are linear classifiers, Logistic Regression makes a prediction for the probability using a direct functional form where as Naive Bayes figures out how the data was generated given the results.
1789	Performance Testing is a software testing process used for testing the speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability and resource usage of a software application under particular workload.  It is a subset of performance engineering and also known as “Perf Testing”.
1790	"In statistical hypothesis testing, a type I error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis (also known as a ""false positive"" finding or conclusion; example: ""an innocent person is convicted""), while a type II error is the non-rejection of a false null hypothesis (also known as a ""false negative"" finding or conclusion"
1791	A false negative pregnancy test is more common than false positive because a woman may get a negative test when HCG levels are too low. Very few things can mimic HCG, however, so as long as a pregnancy test is working correctly, the odds of a false positive test are virtually zero.
1792	In Neural network, some inputs are provided to an artificial neuron, and with each input a weight is associated. Weight increases the steepness of activation function. This means weight decide how fast the activation function will trigger whereas bias is used to delay the triggering of the activation function.
1793	“Bayesian statistics is a mathematical procedure that applies probabilities to statistical problems. It provides people the tools to update their beliefs in the evidence of new data.”
1794	No, you don't have to transform your observed variables just because they don't follow a normal distribution. Linear regression analysis, which includes t-test and ANOVA, does not assume normality for either predictors (IV) or an outcome (DV). No way!  Yes, you should check normality of errors AFTER modeling.
1795	Control Charts: A discrete distribution is one in which the data can only take on certain values, for example integers. A continuous distribution is one in which data can take on any value within a specified range (which may be infinite).
1796	Arrange data points from smallest to largest and locate the central number. This is the median. If there are 2 numbers in the middle, the median is the average of those 2 numbers. The mode is the number in a data set that occurs most frequently.
1797	Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) is used when our goal is to reduce the variance of a decision tree. Here idea is to create several subsets of data from training sample chosen randomly with replacement. Now, each collection of subset data is used to train their decision trees.
1798	The images shows that a higher VC dimension allows for a lower empirical risk (the error a model makes on the sample data), but also introduces a higher confidence interval. This interval can be seen as the confidence in the model's ability to generalize.
1799	The T distribution is similar to the normal distribution, just with fatter tails. Both assume a normally distributed population. T distributions have higher kurtosis than normal distributions. The probability of getting values very far from the mean is larger with a T distribution than a normal distribution.
1800	Among the learning algorithms, one of the most popular and easiest to understand is the decision tree induction.

Decision tree can be used for both classification and regression kind of problem.
1801	One way of finding a point estimate ˆx=g(y) is to find a function g(Y) that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE). Here, we show that g(y)=E[X|Y=y] has the lowest MSE among all possible estimators. That is why it is called the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate.
1802	In fitting a neural network, backpropagation computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation of the gradient with respect to each weight individually.
1803	You description is confusing, but it is totally possible to have test error both lower and higher than training error. A lower training error is expected when a method easily overfits to the training data, yet, poorly generalizes.
1804	While many people use the terms interchangeably, data science and big data analytics are unique fields, with the major difference being the scope.  Data science produces broader insights that concentrate on which questions should be asked, while big data analytics emphasizes discovering answers to questions being asked.
1805	Key Differences between AI, ML, and NLP ML is an application of AI. Machine Learning is basically the ability of a system to learn by itself without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a part of Machine Learning which is applied to larger data-sets and based on ANN (Artificial Neural Networks).
1806	The need for a CNN with variable input dimensions FCN is a network that does not contain any “Dense” layers (as in traditional CNNs) instead it contains 1x1 convolutions that perform the task of fully connected layers (Dense layers).
1807	Multinomial theorem is actually not in the syllabus but learning this topic well can save your time as well as will make the problems of permutations and combinations look easy.
1808	Partial correlation holds variable X3 constant for both the other two variables. Whereas, Semipartial correlation holds variable X3 for only one variable (either X1 or X2). Hence, it is called 'semi'partial. There should be linear relationship between all the three variables.
1809	A hypothesis test for a population mean when the population standard deviation, σ, is unknown is conducted in the same way as if the population standard deviation is known. The only difference is that the t-distribution is invoked, instead of the standard normal distribution (z-distribution).
1810	An efficient portfolio is either a portfolio that offers the highest expected return for a given level of risk, or one with the lowest level of risk for a given expected return.  The efficient frontier represents that set of portfolios that has the maximum rate of return for every given level of risk.

1813	Item based collaborative filtering finds similarity patterns between items and recommends them to users based on the computed information, whilst user based finds similar users and gives them recommendations based on what other people with similar consumption patterns appreciated[3].
1814	The output unit is used to present soft and hardcopy of information. The VDU (Visual Display Unit or Monitor) and printer are common output units. There are many categories of display units available for computer.
1815	The median absolute deviation and interquartile range are robust measures of statistical dispersion, while the standard deviation and range are not. Trimmed estimators and Winsorised estimators are general methods to make statistics more robust.
1816	Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers. A uniform distribution would be the extreme case.
1817	2. HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical model that can be used to describe the evolution of observable events that depend on internal factors, which are not directly observable. We call the observed event a `symbol' and the invisible factor underlying the observation a `state'.

1819	The degree of freedom defines as the capability of a body to move. Consider a rectangular box, in space the box is capable of moving in twelve different directions (six rotational and six axial). Each direction of movement is counted as one degree of freedom. i.e. a body in space has twelve degree of freedom.
1820	What one hot encoding does is, it takes a column which has categorical data, which has been label encoded, and then splits the column into multiple columns. The numbers are replaced by 1s and 0s, depending on which column has what value.  So, that's the difference between Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding.
1821	There are two main types of criterion validity: concurrent validity and predictive validity. Concurrent validity is determined by comparing tests scores of current employees to a measure of their job performance.
1822	The probability that a random variable X X X takes a value in the (open or closed) interval [ a , b ] [a,b] [a,b] is given by the integral of a function called the probability density function f X ( x ) f_X(x) fX​(x): P ( a ≤ X ≤ b ) = ∫ a b f X ( x ) d x .
1823	The error sum of squares is obtained by first computing the mean lifetime of each battery type. For each battery of a specified type, the mean is subtracted from each individual battery's lifetime and then squared. The sum of these squared terms for all battery types equals the SSE. SSE is a measure of sampling error.
1824	ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s.

1826	The goodness of fit test is a statistical hypothesis test to see how well sample data fit a distribution from a population with a normal distribution. Put differently, this test shows if your sample data represents the data you would expect to find in the actual population or if it is somehow skewed.
1827	The Linear Regression Equation The equation has the form Y= a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable (that's the variable that goes on the Y axis), X is the independent variable (i.e. it is plotted on the X axis), b is the slope of the line and a is the y-intercept.

1836	Two types of statistical methods are used in analyzing data: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics are used to synopsize data from a sample exercising the mean or standard deviation. Inferential statistics are used when data is viewed as a subclass of a specific population.
1837	Time series data means that data is in a series of particular time periods or intervals.

The exercise is conceptually simple: Choose the gain, rate, and reset parameters that define the relative magnitude of the P, I, and D contributions to the overall control effort.
1840	Data Science Interview Questions based on AUC. AUC stands for Area Under the Curve.  The way it is done is to see how much area has been covered by the ROC curve. If we obtain a perfect classifier, then the AUC score is 1.0. If the classifier is random in its guesses, then the AUC score is 0.5.
1841	Gradient boosting is a type of machine learning boosting. It relies on the intuition that the best possible next model, when combined with previous models, minimizes the overall prediction error. The key idea is to set the target outcomes for this next model in order to minimize the error.
1842	Unlabeled data is data that comes with no tag. So what is then, supervised and unsupervised learning? Clearly, it is better to have labeled data than unlabeled data. With a labeled dataset, we can do much more. But there are still many things that we can do with an unlabeled dataset.
1843	Generally, standardized scores refer to raw data being converted to standard or normalized scores in order to maintain uniformity in interpretation of statistical data.  Z scores are one of the most commonly used scores for data in statistics. They are also known as normal scores and standardized variables.
1844	Feature Selection is the process where you automatically or manually select those features which contribute most to your prediction variable or output in which you are interested in. Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of the models and make your model learn based on irrelevant features.

1862	Positive and negative predictive values are influenced by the prevalence of disease in the population that is being tested. If we test in a high prevalence setting, it is more likely that persons who test positive truly have disease than if the test is performed in a population with low prevalence..
1863	In statistics, principal component regression (PCR) is a regression analysis technique that is based on principal component analysis (PCA).  In PCR, instead of regressing the dependent variable on the explanatory variables directly, the principal components of the explanatory variables are used as regressors.
1864	In machine learning and mathematical optimization, loss functions for classification are computationally feasible loss functions representing the price paid for inaccuracy of predictions in classification problems (problems of identifying which category a particular observation belongs to).
1865	A histogram is drawn like a bar chart, but often has bars of unequal width. It is the area of the bar that tells us the frequency in a histogram, not its height. Instead of plotting frequency on the y-axis, we plot the frequency density. To calculate this, you divide the frequency of a group by the width of it.
1866	An expert system is an example of a knowledge-based system. Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge-based architecture.

Decision tree software helps businesses draw out their trees, assigns value and probabilities to each branch and analyzes each option.
1870	The expected value of the sum of several random variables is equal to the sum of their expectations, e.g., E[X+Y] = E[X]+ E[Y] . On the other hand, the expected value of the product of two random variables is not necessarily the product of the expected values.
1871	A curve or pattern in the residual plot indicates a nonlinear relationship in the original data set. A random scatter of points in the residual plot indicates a linear relationship in the original data set.
1872	Generally speaking, non-probability sampling can be a more cost-effective and faster approach than probability sampling, but this depends on a number of variables including the target population being studied.

1890	Two events are said to be mutually exclusive when the two events cannot occur at the same time. For instance, when you throw a coin the event that a head appears and the event that a tail appears are mutually exclusive because they cannot occur at the same time, it's either a head appears or a tail appears.
1891	Z-tests are statistical calculations that can be used to compare population means to a sample's. T-tests are calculations used to test a hypothesis, but they are most useful when we need to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between two independent sample groups.
1892	In statistics, the method of moments is a method of estimation of population parameters. It starts by expressing the population moments (i.e., the expected values of powers of the random variable under consideration) as functions of the parameters of interest.  The solutions are estimates of those parameters.

1899	When we control for variables that have a postive correlation with both the independent and the dependent variable, the original relationship will be pushed down, and become more negative. The same is true if we control for a variable that has a negative correlation with both independent and dependent.
1900	Sampling error is the difference between a population parameter and a sample statistic used to estimate it. For example, the difference between a population mean and a sample mean is sampling error. Sampling error occurs because a portion, and not the entire population, is surveyed.…
1901	Another serious limitation is that practitioners need to develop new skills in seeking and appraising evidence, which takes considerable time and effort. Without these skills practitioners are prone to confirmation bias – seeing only the evidence that supports their personal experience and judgment.

2426	The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger — no matter what the shape of the population distribution.
2427	Explanation: The two types of Fourier series are- Trigonometric and exponential.
2428	The cumulative distribution function, CDF, or cumulant is a function derived from the probability density function for a continuous random variable. It gives the probability of finding the random variable at a value less than or equal to a given cutoff.
2429	"The sampling distribution of the sample mean can be thought of as ""For a sample of size n, the sample mean will behave according to this distribution."" Any random draw from that sampling distribution would be interpreted as the mean of a sample of n observations from the original population."
2430	It's O(V+E) because each visit to v of V must visit each e of E where |e| <= V-1. Since there are V visits to v of V then that is O(V).  So total time complexity is O(V + E).

2433	The expected number of false positives if the rate is set at 5% should be 5%. In general, this rate is higher, because investigators fail to include all sources of uncertainty when calculating the expected false positive rate.
2434	One reason you should consider when using ReLUs is, that they can produce dead neurons. That means that under certain circumstances your network can produce regions in which the network won't update, and the output is always 0.
2435	As regards the normality of group data, the one-way ANOVA can tolerate data that is non-normal (skewed or kurtotic distributions) with only a small effect on the Type I error rate. However, platykurtosis can have a profound effect when your group sizes are small.
2436	Probability density function (PDF) is a statistical expression that defines a probability distribution (the likelihood of an outcome) for a discrete random variable (e.g., a stock or ETF) as opposed to a continuous random variable.
2437	In some cases, the measurement scale for data is ordinal, but the variable is treated as continuous. For example, a Likert scale that contains five values - strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree - is ordinal.
2438	A probability sampling method is any method of sampling that utilizes some form of random selection. In order to have a random selection method, you must set up some process or procedure that assures that the different units in your population have equal probabilities of being chosen.

We then clus- ter the set of points into k clusters using a standard k- means algorithm. Finally, we recursively cluster each sub-cluster until we hit some small fixed number of points.
2450	No. Since the response variable is binary there's no such thing as heteroscedasticity in this context. You might want to check for the distribution of the predictors.
2451	The basic idea is to use existing IDSs as an alert source and then apply either off-line (using data mining) or on-line (using machine learning) alert processing to reduce the number of false positives. Moreover, owing to their complementary nature, both approaches can also be used together.

2486	Causation is the relationship between cause and effect. So, when a cause results in an effect, that's a causation.  When we say that correlation does not imply cause, we mean that just because you can see a connection or a mutual relationship between two variables, it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes the other.

2737	Relative frequencies can be written as fractions, percents, or decimals. The column should add up to 1 (or 100%). The only difference between a relative frequency distribution graph and a frequency distribution graph is that the vertical axis uses proportional or relative frequency rather than simple frequency.
2738	The learning rate hyperparameter controls the rate or speed at which the model learns.  A learning rate that is too small may never converge or may get stuck on a suboptimal solution. When the learning rate is too large, gradient descent can inadvertently increase rather than decrease the training error.

3106	Nonresponse bias occurs when some respondents included in the sample do not respond. The key difference here is that the error comes from an absence of respondents instead of the collection of erroneous data.  Most often, this form of bias is created by refusals to participate or the inability to reach some respondents.
3107	The actor-observer bias tends to be more pronounced in situations where the outcomes are negative. 1﻿ For example, in a situation where a person experiences something negative, the individual will often blame the situation or circumstances.

3619	Generally, a machine learning pipeline describes or models your ML process: writing code, releasing it to production, performing data extractions, creating training models, and tuning the algorithm. An ML pipeline should be a continuous process as a team works on their ML platform.
3620	If the sample being tested falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted instead of the null hypothesis. The two-tailed test gets its name from testing the area under both tails of a normal distribution, although the test can be used in other non-normal distributions.
3621	Answer. True is the answer of Restricted Boltzmann Machine expect data to be labeled for Training as because there are two process for training one which is called as pre-training and training. In pre-training one don't need labeled data.
3622	We say that X and Y are independent if P(X=x,Y=y)=P(X=x)P(Y=y), for all x,y.  Intuitively, two random variables X and Y are independent if knowing the value of one of them does not change the probabilities for the other one. In other words, if X and Y are independent, we can write P(Y=y|X=x)=P(Y=y), for all x,y.
3623	A Classification report is used to measure the quality of predictions from a classification algorithm.  The report shows the main classification metrics precision, recall and f1-score on a per-class basis. The metrics are calculated by using true and false positives, true and false negatives.
3624	"A dependent variable is what you measure in the experiment and what is affected during the experiment. The dependent variable responds to the independent variable. It is called dependent because it ""depends"" on the independent variable."
3625	K-Means clustering algorithm instead converses on local minima which might also correspond to the global minima in some cases but not always.  But that is done by simply making the algorithm choose the set of same random no. for each run.

3629	An intuitive idea of the general shape of the distribution can also be obtained by considering this sum of squares. Since χ2 is the sum of a set of squared values, it can never be negative. The minimum chi squared value would be obtained if each Z = 0 so that χ2 would also be 0. There is no upper limit to the χ2 value.
3630	The number of bootstrap samples can be indicated with B (e.g. if you resample 10 times then B = 10). A star next to a statistic, like s* or x̄* indicates the statistic was calculated by resampling. A bootstrap statistic is sometimes denoted with a T, where T*b would be the Bth bootstrap sample statistic T.
3631	"In statistics, self-selection bias arises in any situation in which individuals select themselves into a group, causing a biased sample with nonprobability sampling.  In such fields, a poll suffering from such bias is termed a self-selected listener opinion poll or ""SLOP""."
3632	Categorical variables require special attention in regression analysis because, unlike dichotomous or continuous variables, they cannot by entered into the regression equation just as they are. Instead, they need to be recoded into a series of variables which can then be entered into the regression model.
3633	Causation is the relationship between cause and effect. So, when a cause results in an effect, that's a causation.  When we say that correlation does not imply cause, we mean that just because you can see a connection or a mutual relationship between two variables, it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes the other.
3634	Train Loss is the value of the objective function that you are minimizing. This value could be a positive or negative number, depending on the specific objective function of your training data. The training loss is calculated over the entire training dataset.
3635	"To properly analyze Likert data, one must understand the measurement scale represented by each. Numbers assigned to Likert-type items express a ""greater than"" relationship; however, how much greater is not implied. Because of these conditions, Likert-type items fall into the ordinal measurement scale."

3640	Again, feature selection keeps a subset of the original features while feature extraction creates new ones. As with feature selection, some algorithms already have built-in feature extraction.  As a stand-alone task, feature extraction can be unsupervised (i.e. PCA) or supervised (i.e. LDA).
3641	"The maximum or minimum over the entire function is called an ""Absolute"" or ""Global"" maximum or minimum. There is only one global maximum (and one global minimum) but there can be more than one local maximum or minimum. Assuming this function continues downwards to left or right: The Global Maximum is about 3.7."
3642	Two approaches to avoiding overfitting are distinguished: pre-pruning (generating a tree with fewer branches than would otherwise be the case) and post-pruning (generating a tree in full and then removing parts of it). Results are given for pre-pruning using either a size or a maximum depth cutoff.
3643	The Binomial Theorem: Formulas. The Binomial Theorem is a quick way (okay, it's a less slow way) of expanding (or multiplying out) a binomial expression that has been raised to some (generally inconveniently large) power. For instance, the expression (3x – 2)10 would be very painful to multiply out by hand.
3644	The year is a categorical variable. The ratio between two years is not meaningful which is why its not appropriate to classify it as a quantitative variable.
3645	Brownian motion lies in the intersection of several important classes of processes. It is a Gaussian Markov process, it has continuous paths, it is a process with stationary independent increments (a Lévy process), and it is a martingale. Several characterizations are known based on these properties.
3646	CRF is a discriminant model. MEMM is not a generative model, but a model with finite states based on state classification. HMM and MEMM are a directed graph, while CRF is an undirected graph. HMM directly models the transition probability and the phenotype probability, and calculates the probability of co-occurrence.
3647	Sampling distributions are important for inferential statistics. In practice, one will collect sample data and, from these data, estimate parameters of the population distribution. Thus, knowledge of the sampling distribution can be very useful in making inferences about the overall population.

SequenceMatcher(isjunk, a, b) with isJunk set to None to get a SequenceMatcher() object representing the similarity between the strings. Call ratio() on this object to get the ratio of matching characters to total characters.
3649	In general, as sample size increases, the difference between expected adjusted r-squared and expected r-squared approaches zero; in theory this is because expected r-squared becomes less biased. the standard error of adjusted r-squared would get smaller approaching zero in the limit.
3650	R-squared is a goodness-of-fit measure for linear regression models. This statistic indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables explain collectively.  After fitting a linear regression model, you need to determine how well the model fits the data.
3651	The geometric mean differs from the arithmetic average, or arithmetic mean, in how it is calculated because it takes into account the compounding that occurs from period to period. Because of this, investors usually consider the geometric mean a more accurate measure of returns than the arithmetic mean.

The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable."
3743	"In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. A standard integrated circuit can be seen as a digital network of activation functions that can be ""ON"" (1) or ""OFF"" (0), depending on input."

4148	The covariance between X and Y is defined as Cov(X,Y)=E[(X−EX)(Y−EY)]=E[XY]−(EX)(EY).The covariance has the following properties:Cov(X,X)=Var(X);if X and Y are independent then Cov(X,Y)=0;Cov(X,Y)=Cov(Y,X);Cov(aX,Y)=aCov(X,Y);Cov(X+c,Y)=Cov(X,Y);Cov(X+Y,Z)=Cov(X,Z)+Cov(Y,Z);more generally,
4149	In our implementation of gradient descent, we have used a function compute_gradient(loss) that computes the gradient of a loss operation in our computational graph with respect to the output of every other node n (i.e. the direction of change for n along which the loss increases the most).
4150	When q-learning is performed we create what's called a q-table or matrix that follows the shape of [state, action] and we initialize our values to zero. We then update and store our q-values after an episode. This q-table becomes a reference table for our agent to select the best action based on the q-value.
4151	Interpreting the Range The range is interpreted as the overall dispersion of values in a dataset or, more literally, as the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a dataset. The range is measured in the same units as the variable of reference and, thus, has a direct interpretation as such.

4158	A sample refers to a smaller, manageable version of a larger group. It is a subset containing the characteristics of a larger population. Samples are used in statistical testing when population sizes are too large for the test to include all possible members or observations.
4159	Back-propagation is just a way of propagating the total loss back into the neural network to know how much of the loss every node is responsible for, and subsequently updating the weights in such a way that minimizes the loss by giving the nodes with higher error rates lower weights and vice versa.
4160	A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa.
4161	5 Most Important Methods For Statistical Data AnalysisMean. The arithmetic mean, more commonly known as “the average,” is the sum of a list of numbers divided by the number of items on the list.  Standard Deviation.  Regression.  Sample Size Determination.  Hypothesis Testing.
4162	Word vectors are simply vectors of numbers that represent the meaning of a word.  In simpler terms, a word vector is a row of real-valued numbers (as opposed to dummy numbers) where each point captures a dimension of the word's meaning and where semantically similar words have similar vectors.
4163	Trends are determined by a combination of volume and how much time it takes to create volume. In other words, one-day growth is trending, while 30 days is just more news.  Because the number of tweets using the hashtag, #FreddieGrey, built up over time, volume increased at the same rate of traffic.
4164	7 Techniques to Handle Imbalanced DataUse the right evaluation metrics.  Resample the training set.  Use K-fold Cross-Validation in the right way.  Ensemble different resampled datasets.  Resample with different ratios.  Cluster the abundant class.  Design your own models.
4165	Inductive Learning is where we are given examples of a function in the form of data (x) and the output of the function (f(x)). The goal of inductive learning is to learn the function for new data (x). Classification: when the function being learned is discrete. Regression: when the function being learned is continuous.
4166	With supervised learning, you have features and labels. The features are the descriptive attributes, and the label is what you're attempting to predict or forecast.
4167	Area Under Curve(AUC) is one of the most widely used metrics for evaluation. It is used for binary classification problem. AUC of a classifier is equal to the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative example.
4168	Content-based recommendation systems uses their knowledge about each product to recommend new ones. Recommendations are based on attributes of the item. Content-based recommender systems work well when descriptive data on the content is provided beforehand. “Similarity” is measured against product attributes.
4169	Alternatively, general dimensionality reduction techniques are used such as:Independent component analysis.Isomap.Kernel PCA.Latent semantic analysis.Partial least squares.Principal component analysis.Multifactor dimensionality reduction.Nonlinear dimensionality reduction.More items
4170	Like I said before, the AUC-ROC curve is only for binary classification problems. But we can extend it to multiclass classification problems by using the One vs All technique. So, if we have three classes 0, 1, and 2, the ROC for class 0 will be generated as classifying 0 against not 0, i.e. 1 and 2.
4171	Yes, there are. One example is the WEKA MOA framework [1]. This framework implements standard algorithms in the literature of concept drift detection.  The nice thing about this framework is that it allows users to generate new data streams which contains concept drifts of different types.
4172	Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range.  If feature scaling is not done, then a machine learning algorithm tends to weigh greater values, higher and consider smaller values as the lower values, regardless of the unit of the values.
4173	Examples of such greedy algorithms are Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees, and the algorithm for finding optimum Huffman trees.
4174	The consistency of the sampling distribution is dependent on the sample size not on the distribution of the population. As the sample size decreases the absolute value of the skewness and kurtosis of the sampling distribution increases. This sample size relationship is expressed in the central limit theorem.
4175	In the AI-enabled future, humans will be able to converse and interact with each other in the native language of choice, not having to worry about miscommunicating intentions. Machine learning models will be able to understand context, nuance, and colloquialisms that help to fill the gaps of human communication.

4178	Since is more degree 4 will be more complex(overfit the data) than the degree 3 model so it will again perfectly fit the data. In such case training error will be zero but test error may not be zero.
4179	Partial correlation is a measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables whilst controlling for the effect of one or more other continuous variables (also known as 'covariates' or 'control' variables).
4180	A decision tree is built on an entire dataset, using all the features/variables of interest, whereas a random forest randomly selects observations/rows and specific features/variables to build multiple decision trees from and then averages the results.
4181	Filters typically are applied to data in the data processing stage or the preprocessing stage. Filters enhance the clarity of the signal that's used for machine learning.
4182	In clustering, a group of different data objects is classified as similar objects. One group means a cluster of data. Data sets are divided into different groups in the cluster analysis, which is based on the similarity of the data. After the classification of data into various groups, a label is assigned to the group.
4183	Properties. Unlike the classical conditional entropy, the conditional quantum entropy can be negative.  Positive conditional entropy of a state thus means the state cannot reach even the classical limit, while the negative conditional entropy provides for additional information.
4184	K-NN is a lazy learner because it doesn't learn a discriminative function from the training data but “memorizes” the training dataset instead. For example, the logistic regression algorithm learns its model weights (parameters) during training time.  A lazy learner does not have a training phase.
4185	The main difference between stratified sampling and cluster sampling is that with cluster sampling, you have natural groups separating your population.  In stratified sampling, a sample is drawn from each strata (using a random sampling method like simple random sampling or systematic sampling).
4186	There is really only one advantage to using a random forest over a decision tree: It reduces overfitting and is therefore more accurate.
4187	You can tell if two random variables are independent by looking at their individual probabilities. If those probabilities don't change when the events meet, then those variables are independent. Another way of saying this is that if the two variables are correlated, then they are not independent.
4188	"A parameter is any summary number, like an average or percentage, that describes the entire population. The population mean (the greek letter ""mu"") and the population proportion p are two different population parameters. For example:  The population comprises all likely American voters, and the parameter is p."
4189	An experimental group is a test sample or the group that receives an experimental procedure. This group is exposed to changes in the independent variable being tested.  A control group is a group separated from the rest of the experiment such that the independent variable being tested cannot influence the results.
4190	Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself.
4191	Just like the post period dummy variable controls for factors changing over time that are common to both treatment and control groups, the year fixed effects (i.e. year dummy variables) control for factors changing each year that are common to all cities for a given year.

Then it assigns random weights to those networks and employs genetic algorithm to evolve the weights so that they can characterize to some extent the fitness of the neural networks in constituting an ensemble.
4195	The primary purpose of Convolution in case of a ConvNet is to extract features from the input image. Convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data.

4200	There are multiple ways to select a good starting point for the learning rate. A naive approach is to try a few different values and see which one gives you the best loss without sacrificing speed of training. We might start with a large value like 0.1, then try exponentially lower values: 0.01, 0.001, etc.
4201	Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

4351	Typically, unlabeled data consists of samples of natural or human-created artifacts that you can obtain relatively easily from the world.  Semi-supervised learning attempts to combine unlabeled and labeled data (or, more generally, sets of unlabeled data where only some data points have labels) into integrated models.
4352	Variability and Sample Sizes Increasing or decreasing sample sizes leads to changes in the variability of samples. For example, a sample size of 10 people taken from the same population of 1,000 will very likely give you a very different result than a sample size of 100.  Next: Sampling Distributions.

By iterative filtering for quality solution from competing ones, the probability model eventually approximates the distribution of global optimum solutions.
4383	First, it is a very quick estimate of the standard deviation. The standard deviation requires us to first find the mean, then subtract this mean from each data point, square the differences, add these, divide by one less than the number of data points, then (finally) take the square root.
4384	So, we have listed some of the ways where you can achieve trade-off between the two. Both bias and variance are related to each other, if you increase one the other decreases and vice versa.

4683	The joint behavior of two random variables X and Y is determined by the. joint cumulative distribution function (cdf):(1.1) FXY (x, y) = P(X ≤ x, Y ≤ y),where X and Y are continuous or discrete. For example, the probability.  P(x1 ≤ X ≤ x2,y1 ≤ Y ≤ y2) = F(x2,y2) − F(x2,y1) − F(x1,y2) + F(x1,y1).
4684	Bimodal Distribution: Two Peaks. The bimodal distribution has two peaks.  However, if you think about it, the peaks in any distribution are the most common number(s). The two peaks in a bimodal distribution also represent two local maximums; these are points where the data points stop increasing and start decreasing.
4685	Nonparametric tests have the following limitations: Nonparametric tests are usually less powerful than corresponding parametric test when the normality assumption holds. Thus, you are less likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is false if the data comes from the normal distribution.
4686	The Four Probability Rules P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A and B)  Specifically, if event A is already known to have occurred and probability of event B is desired, then we have the following rule. P(B, given A)=P(A and B)P(A) In set notation, this is written as P(B|A)=P(A∩B)P(A).
4687	The prior probability of an event will be revised as new data or information becomes available, to produce a more accurate measure of a potential outcome. That revised probability becomes the posterior probability and is calculated using Bayes' theorem.
4688	PCA is designed to model linear variabilities in high-dimensional data. However, many high dimensional data sets have a nonlinear nature. In these cases the high-dimensional data lie on or near a nonlinear manifold (not a linear subspace) and therefore PCA can not model the variability of the data correctly.
4689	"AUC stands for ""Area under the ROC Curve."" That is, AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (0,0) to (1,1). Figure 5. AUC (Area under the ROC Curve). AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds."
4690	To estimate the oriented bounding box, you need to train the network with objects and their oriented bounding boxes. For that, you need to modify the bounding box regression head of the network. Frustum PointNet[2] employs such regression but for the 3D bounding boxes. It can easily be extended for the 2D use cases.
4691	Image compression with principal component analysis is a frequently occurring application of the dimension reduction technique.  As the number of principal components used to project the new data increases, the quality and representation compared to the original image improve.
4692	Measuring the Accuracy of a Test By calculating ratios between these values, we can quantitatively measure the accuracy of our tests. The false positive rate is calculated as FP/FP+TN, where FP is the number of false positives and TN is the number of true negatives (FP+TN being the total number of negatives).
4693	The distribution of a categorical variable lists all of the values the variable takes and how often it takes each of these values.
4694	An algorithm is considered efficient if its resource consumption, also known as computational cost, is at or below some acceptable level. Roughly speaking, 'acceptable' means: it will run in a reasonable amount of time or space on an available computer, typically as a function of the size of the input.
4695	On average the interpolation search makes about log(log(n)) comparisons (if the elements are uniformly distributed), where n is the number of elements to be searched. In the worst case (for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially) it can make up to O(n) comparisons.
4696	The tool of normal approximation allows us to approximate the probabilities of random variables for which we don't know all of the values, or for a very large range of potential values that would be very difficult and time consuming to calculate.
4697	Neural network converts data in such a form that it would be better to solve the desired problem. This is called representation learning.
4698	In statistics, the mode is the most commonly observed value in a set of data. For the normal distribution, the mode is also the same value as the mean and median. In many cases, the modal value will differ from the average value in the data.

4711	ReLu bounded negative outputs to 0 & above. This works well in hidden layers than the final output layer.  It is not typical, since in this case, the ouput value is not bounded in a range.
4712	The survival function is S(t) = Pr(T >t)=1 − F(t). – The survival function gives the probability that a subject will survive past time t.
4713	Hypothesis Testing > Results from a statistical tests will fall into one of two regions: the rejection region— which will lead you to reject the null hypothesis, or the acceptance region, where you provisionally accept the null hypothesis.
4714	A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about a population parameter. This assumption may or may not be true. Hypothesis testing refers to the formal procedures used by statisticians to accept or reject statistical hypotheses.
4715	"The consequent of a conditional statement is the part that usually follows ""then"". The part that usually follows ""if"" is called the ""antecedent"".  To affirm the consequent is, of course, to claim that the consequent is true. Thus, affirming the consequent in the example would be to claim that I have logic class."

4718	Quantization is the concept that a physical quantity can have only certain discrete values.  For example, matter is quantized because it is composed of individual particles that cannot be subdivided; it is not possible to have half an electron. Also, the energy levels of electrons in atoms are quantized.
4719	Statistical significance is used to provide evidence concerning the plausibility of the null hypothesis, which hypothesizes that there is nothing more than random chance at work in the data. Statistical hypothesis testing is used to determine whether the result of a data set is statistically significant.
4720	The normal distribution is a probability distribution. It is also called Gaussian distribution because it was first discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss.  It is often called the bell curve, because the graph of its probability density looks like a bell. Many values follow a normal distribution.
4721	The normal distribution is the most important probability distribution in statistics because it fits many natural phenomena. For example, heights, blood pressure, measurement error, and IQ scores follow the normal distribution. It is also known as the Gaussian distribution and the bell curve.
4722	There are three big-picture methods to understand if a continuous and categorical are significantly correlated — point biserial correlation, logistic regression, and Kruskal Wallis H Test. The point biserial correlation coefficient is a special case of Pearson's correlation coefficient.
4723	Sample variance Dividing instead by n − 1 yields an unbiased estimator.  In other words, the expected value of the uncorrected sample variance does not equal the population variance σ2, unless multiplied by a normalization factor. The sample mean, on the other hand, is an unbiased estimator of the population mean μ.
4724	The law of averages is not a mathematical principle, whereas the law of large numbers is. In probability theory, the law of large numbers is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times.
4725	It is well known that correlation does not prove causation. What is less well known is that causation can exist when correlation is zero. The upshot of these two facts is that, in general and without additional information, correlation reveals literally nothing about causation.
4726	Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a statistical method of analysis that estimates the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable; the method estimates the relationship by minimizing the sum of the squares in the difference between the observed and predicted values of the
4727	Statistical inference comprises the application of methods to analyze the sample data in order to estimate the population parameters.  The concept of normal (also called gaussian) sampling distribution has an important role in statistical inference, even when the population values are not normally distributed.
4728	Parametric tests assume a normal distribution of values, or a “bell-shaped curve.” For example, height is roughly a normal distribution in that if you were to graph height from a group of people, one would see a typical bell-shaped curve.

4731	Machine learning can be described in many ways. Perhaps the most useful is as type of optimization.  This is done via what is known as an objective function, with “objective” used in the sense of a goal. This function, taking data and model parameters as arguments, can be evaluated to return a number.
4732	Three keys to managing bias when building AIChoose the right learning model for the problem. There's a reason all AI models are unique: Each problem requires a different solution and provides varying data resources.  Choose a representative training data set.  Monitor performance using real data.
4733	The easiest way to convert categorical variables to continuous is by replacing raw categories with the average response value of the category. cutoff : minimum observations in a category. All the categories having observations less than the cutoff will be a different category.
4734	When I calculate population variance, I then divide the sum of squared deviations from the mean by the number of items in the population (in example 1 I was dividing by 12). When I calculate sample variance, I divide it by the number of items in the sample less one. In our example 2, I divide by 99 (100 less 1).
4735	Bias in Machine Learning is defined as the phenomena of observing results that are systematically prejudiced due to faulty assumptions.  This also results in bias which arises from the choice of training and test data and their representation of the true population.
4736	The AUC for the ROC can be calculated using the roc_auc_score() function. Like the roc_curve() function, the AUC function takes both the true outcomes (0,1) from the test set and the predicted probabilities for the 1 class. It returns the AUC score between 0.0 and 1.0 for no skill and perfect skill respectively.

4744	If you have outliers, the best way is to use a clustering algorithm that can handle them. For example DBSCAN clustering is robust against outliers when you choose minpts large enough. Don't use k-means: the squared error approach is sensitive to outliers. But there are variants such as k-means-- for handling outliers.
4745	Learning involves far more than thinking: it involves the whole personality - senses, feelings, intuition, beliefs, values and will.  Learning occurs when we are able to: Gain a mental or physical grasp of the subject. Make sense of a subject, event or feeling by interpreting it into our own words or actions.
4746	"Poisson regression is used to predict a dependent variable that consists of ""count data"" given one or more independent variables. The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes the response, outcome, target or criterion variable)."
4747	Dimensional analysis provides you with an alternative approach to problem solving. Problems in which a measurement with one unit is converted to an equivalent measurement with another unit are easily solved using dimensional analysis. They form cations with positive charges equal to their group number.

Minitab uses the mean rank to calculate the H-value, which is the test statistic for the Kruskal-Wallis test.  If two or more observations are tied, Minitab assigns the average rank to each tied observation.
4752	Discrete distributions have a countable number of outcomes, which means that the potential outcomes can be put into a list. The list may be finite or infinite; the Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution whose list {0, 1, 2, } is infinite.

4768	Parametric tests are those that make assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution from which the sample is drawn. This is often the assumption that the population data are normally distributed. Non-parametric tests are “distribution-free” and, as such, can be used for non-Normal variables.

5772	The regression slope intercept formula, b0 = y – b1 * x is really just an algebraic variation of the regression equation, y' = b0 + b1x where “b0” is the y-intercept and b1x is the slope. Once you've found the linear regression equation, all that's required is a little algebra to find the y-intercept (or the slope).
5773	The other assumption of one-way anova is that the variation within the groups is equal (homoscedasticity). While Kruskal-Wallis does not assume that the data are normal, it does assume that the different groups have the same distribution, and groups with different standard deviations have different distributions.
5774	The p-value is calculated using the sampling distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, the sample data, and the type of test being done (lower-tailed test, upper-tailed test, or two-sided test).  an upper-tailed test is specified by: p-value = P(TS ts | H 0 is true) = 1 - cdf(ts)

Most people would not consider the improvement practically significant. Caution: The larger the sample size, the more likely a hypothesis test will detect a small difference.
5779	Dropout causes your network to keep only some portion of neurons/weights on each iteration. Sometimes those neurons do not fit the current minibatch well, and this may cause large fluctuations.
5780	Undercoverage bias often occurs as a result of convenience sampling. To eliminate (or at least minimize) the effects of undercoverage bias, a better form of sampling is using a simple random sample. In this type of sample, every member of a population has an equal chance of being selected to be in the sample.

5799	Three keys to managing bias when building AIChoose the right learning model for the problem. There's a reason all AI models are unique: Each problem requires a different solution and provides varying data resources.  Choose a representative training data set.  Monitor performance using real data.
5800	Having more data is always a good idea. It allows the “data to tell for itself,” instead of relying on assumptions and weak correlations. Presence of more data results in better and accurate models.  For example: we do not get a choice to increase the size of training data in data science competitions.
5801	In order to choose the support vectors, we want to maximize the margin m and that implies we reduce the magnitude or norm of the vector that's perpendicular to the hyperplanes(s) and closest to a datapoint. which implies that the lower the norm of vector w, then greater is the margin.

5803	The One-Sample z-test is used when we want to know whether the difference between the mean of a sample mean and the mean of a population is large enough to be statistically significant, that is, if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance.
5804	Use imputation for the missing values. When the response is missing, we can use a predictive model to predict the missing response, then create a new fully-observed dataset containing the predictions instead of the missing values, and finally re-estimate the predictive model in this expanded dataset.
5805	Machine learning algorithms are almost always optimized for raw, detailed source data. Thus, the data environment must provision large quantities of raw data for discovery-oriented analytics practices such as data exploration, data mining, statistics, and machine learning.
5806	Prior probability, in Bayesian statistical inference, is the probability of an event before new data is collected. This is the best rational assessment of the probability of an outcome based on the current knowledge before an experiment is performed.
5807	Yes, residual learning is achieved by simply adding an identity mapping parallel to a layer.
5808	In spite of being linear, the Fourier transform is not shift invariant. In other words, a shift in the time domain does not correspond to a shift in the frequency domain.
5809	Examples of False Alarm Ratios The FAR would be: number of false alarms / the total number of warnings or alarms: 8/20 = 0.40. In weather reporting, the false alarm ratio for tornado warnings is the number of false tornado warnings per total number of tornado warnings.
5810	The probability of making a type I error is represented by your alpha level (α), which is the p-value below which you reject the null hypothesis. A p-value of 0.05 indicates that you are willing to accept a 5% chance that you are wrong when you reject the null hypothesis.
5811	Regression Slope Intercept: Overview The regression slope intercept is used in linear regression. The regression slope intercept formula, b0 = y – b1 * x is really just an algebraic variation of the regression equation, y' = b0 + b1x where “b0” is the y-intercept and b1x is the slope.
5812	We often see patterns or relationships in scatterplots. When the y variable tends to increase as the x variable increases, we say there is a positive correlation between the variables. When the y variable tends to decrease as the x variable increases, we say there is a negative correlation between the variables.
5813	A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the true cost to a nearest goal. A heuristic is consistent if, when going from neighboring nodes a to b, the heuristic difference/step cost never overestimates the actual step cost. This can also be re-expressed as the triangle inequality men- tioned in Lecture 3.
5814	The Bag-of-Words (BoW) framework is well-known in image classification. In the framework, there are two essential steps: 1) coding, which encodes local features by a visual vocabulary, and 2) pooling, which pools over the response of all features into image representation.
5815	In natural language processing, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar.
5816	z = (x – μ) / σ For example, let's say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be: z = (x – μ) / σ
5817	A consecutive-k-out-of-n system is a system with n components arranged either linearly or circularly, which fails if and only if at least k consecutive components fail. An (n, f, k) system further requires that the total number of failed components is less than f for the system to be working.

5819	It's greedy because you always mark the closest vertex. It's dynamic because distances are updated using previously calculated values. I would say it's definitely closer to dynamic programming than to a greedy algorithm. To find the shortest distance from A to B, it does not decide which way to go step by step.

5839	The standard error tells you how accurate the mean of any given sample from that population is likely to be compared to the true population mean. When the standard error increases, i.e. the means are more spread out, it becomes more likely that any given mean is an inaccurate representation of the true population mean.
5840	The use of sigmoidal nonlinear functions was inspired by the ouputs of biological neurons.  However, this function is not smooth (it fails to be differential at the threshold value). Therefore, the sigmoid class of functions is a differentiable alternative that still captures much of the behavior of biological neurons.

5850	An association rule has two parts: an antecedent (if) and a consequent (then). An antecedent is an item found within the data.  Support is an indication of how frequently the items appear in the data. Confidence indicates the number of times the if-then statements are found true.
5851	Discriminant validity (or divergent validity) tests that constructs that should have no relationship do, in fact, not have any relationship. If a research program is shown to possess both of these types of validity, it can also be regarded as having excellent construct validity.

5865	The Binomial Theorem: Formulas. The Binomial Theorem is a quick way (okay, it's a less slow way) of expanding (or multiplying out) a binomial expression that has been raised to some (generally inconveniently large) power. For instance, the expression (3x – 2)10 would be very painful to multiply out by hand.

5879	The Poisson Distribution formula is: P(x; μ) = (e-μ) (μx) / x! Let's say that that x (as in the prime counting function is a very big number, like x = 10100. If you choose a random number that's less than or equal to x, the probability of that number being prime is about 0.43 percent.
5880	Connection to stratified sampling Quota sampling is the non-probability version of stratified sampling. In stratified sampling, subsets of the population are created so that each subset has a common characteristic, such as gender.
5881	Variance and standard deviation (Square root of variance) is useful in any control system.  But it is used more often than variance because the unit in which it is measured is the same as that of mean, a measure of central tendency. Variance is measured in square of the units whereas standard deviation in just units.

6445	Multiple regression estimates how the changes in each predictor variable relate to changes in the response variable.  What does it mean to control for the variables in the model? It means that when you look at the effect of one variable in the model, you are holding constant all of the other predictors in the model.

However, for certain distributions there are correction factors that, when multiplied by the sample standard deviation, give you an unbiased estimator."
6494	Linear filtering is the filtering method in which the value of output pixel is linear combinations of the neighbouring input pixels. it can be done with convolution. For examples, mean/average filters or Gaussian filtering. A non-linear filtering is one that cannot be done with convolution or Fourier multiplication.
6495	Nonetheless, they are not the same. Standard deviation is used to measure the spread of data around the mean, while RMSE is used to measure distance between some values and prediction for those values.  If you use mean as your prediction for all the cases, then RMSE and SD will be exactly the same.
6496	"This is in contrast to the Bernoulli, binomial, and hypergeometric distributions, where the number of possible values is finite.  Whereas, in the geometric and negative binomial distributions, the number of ""successes"" is fixed, and we count the number of trials needed to obtain the desired number of ""successes""."

6506	ReLU is an activation function, that nullifies negative neurons, and in its simplicity, it also aids computation speed. However, unlike ELU, it doesn't have a normalizing effect, so BatchNorm helps even better.
6507	In the extended Kalman filter, the state transition and observation models don't need to be linear functions of the state but may instead be differentiable functions.  These matrices can be used in the Kalman filter equations. This process essentially linearizes the non-linear function around the current estimate.
6508	The Pearson correlation evaluates the linear relationship between two continuous variables.  The Spearman correlation coefficient is based on the ranked values for each variable rather than the raw data. Spearman correlation is often used to evaluate relationships involving ordinal variables.

For long studies with large blocks of Matrix Likert scale questions, the number of variables can become unwieldy. Simplifying the data using factor analysis helps analysts focus and clarify the results.
6565	Generally speaking, gradient boosted trees are more robust in multicollinearity situations than OLS regression.  When two independent variables are highly correlated, applying OLS regression could create problems. For example, p-values may not be reliable or even worse the OLS solution can't even be calculated.
6566	When we say that correlation does not imply cause, we mean that just because you can see a connection or a mutual relationship between two variables, it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes the other.

The good thing about a deep thinker is that they'll only speak when they have something important to say so everyone around them knows to listen. This is why they don't see silence as awkward.
6970	Definition: An image processing method that creates a bitonal (aka binary) image based on setting a threshold value on the pixel intensity of the original image.  The thresholding process is sometimes described as separating an image into foreground values (black) and background values (white).
6971	If you want to process the gradients before applying them you can instead use the optimizer in three steps:Compute the gradients with compute_gradients().Process the gradients as you wish.Apply the processed gradients with apply_gradients().
6972	The standard score (more commonly referred to as a z-score) is a very useful statistic because it (a) allows us to calculate the probability of a score occurring within our normal distribution and (b) enables us to compare two scores that are from different normal distributions.
6973	There are two types of probability distribution which are used for different purposes and various types of the data generation process.Normal or Cumulative Probability Distribution.Binomial or Discrete Probability Distribution.
6974	The Finite Population Correction Factor (FPC) is used when you sample without replacement from more than 5% of a finite population. It's needed because under these circumstances, the Central Limit Theorem doesn't hold and the standard error of the estimate (e.g. the mean or proportion) will be too big.
6975	Bayesian decision theory is a fundamental statistical approach to the problem of pattern classification.  This approach is based on quantifying the tradeoffs between various classification decisions using probability and the costs that accompany such decisions.
6976	If you are working on a classification problem, the best score is 100% accuracy. If you are working on a regression problem, the best score is 0.0 error. These scores are an impossible to achieve upper/lower bound.
6977	Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning they change together at a constant rate). It's a common tool for describing simple relationships without making a statement about cause and effect.
6978	You can tell if two random variables are independent by looking at their individual probabilities. If those probabilities don't change when the events meet, then those variables are independent. Another way of saying this is that if the two variables are correlated, then they are not independent.
6979	The singular value decomposition (SVD) provides another way to factorize a matrix, into singular vectors and singular values.  The SVD is used widely both in the calculation of other matrix operations, such as matrix inverse, but also as a data reduction method in machine learning.
6980	The population mean of the distribution of sample means is the same as the population mean of the distribution being sampled from.  Thus as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the means decreases; and as the sample size decreases, the standard deviation of the sample means increases.
6981	For example, let's say a child received a scaled score of 8, with a 95% confidence interval range of 7-9. This means that with high certainty, the child's true score lies between 7 and 9, even if the received score of 8 is not 100% accurate.
6982	String theory has not failed, and there has been progress since 1999. It's just that it's a pretty abstract field of research, so it's hard to describe the recent progress in an accessible and understandable way.

6988	In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.  Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one.
6989	The major difference between using a Z score and a T statistic is that you have to estimate the population standard deviation. The T test is also used if you have a small sample size (less than 30).
6990	K-Nearest Neighbors Underfitting and Overfitting The value of k in the KNN algorithm is related to the error rate of the model.  Overfitting imply that the model is well on the training data but has poor performance when new data is coming.
6991	One such step is eliminating duplicate data as discussed above. Another step is resolving any conflicting data. Sometimes, datasets will have information that conflicts with each other, so data normalization is meant to address this conflicting issue and solve it before continuing. A third step is formatting the data.
6992	Average (or mean) filtering is a method of 'smoothing' images by reducing the amount of intensity variation between neighbouring pixels. The average filter works by moving through the image pixel by pixel, replacing each value with the average value of neighbouring pixels, including itself.
6993	FDR is a very simple concept. It is the number of false discoveries in an experiment divided by total number of discoveries in that experiment.  (You calculate one P-value for each sample or test in your experiment.)
6994	Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve For classification models, there are many other evaluation methods like Gain and Lift charts, Gini coefficient etc. But the in depth knowledge about the confusion matrix can help to evaluate any classification model very effectively.
6995	The essential difference between these two is that Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is binary in nature. In contrast, Linear regression is used when the dependent variable is continuous and nature of the regression line is linear.
6996	Training Set: this data set is used to adjust the weights on the neural network. Validation Set: this data set is used to minimize overfitting.  Testing Set: this data set is used only for testing the final solution in order to confirm the actual predictive power of the network.
6997	A confusion matrix, also known as error matrix is a table layout that is used to visualize the performance of a classification model where the true values are already known.
6998	The main advantage gained in employing an eager learning method, such as an artificial neural network, is that the target function will be approximated globally during training, thus requiring much less space than using a lazy learning system.

7005	The parameters of a neural network are typically the weights of the connections. In this case, these parameters are learned during the training stage. So, the algorithm itself (and the input data) tunes these parameters. The hyper parameters are typically the learning rate, the batch size or the number of epochs.
7006	Parametric alternatives. Another approach to robust estimation of regression models is to replace the normal distribution with a heavy-tailed distribution. A t-distribution with 4–6 degrees of freedom has been reported to be a good choice in various practical situations.
7007	Convolutional neural networks work because it's a good extension from the standard deep-learning algorithm. Given unlimited resources and money, there is no need for convolutional because the standard algorithm will also work. However, convolutional is more efficient because it reduces the number of parameters.
7008	While regular gradient boosting uses the loss function of our base model (e.g. decision tree) as a proxy for minimizing the error of the overall model, XGBoost uses the 2nd order derivative as an approximation.

7011	A significant result indicates that your data are significantly heteroscedastic, and thus the assumption of homoscedasticity in the regression residuals is violated. In your case the data violate the assumption of homoscedasticity, as your p value is 8.6⋅10−28. The e is standard scientific notation for powers of 10.
7012	In statistics, a Poisson distribution is a statistical distribution that shows how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time. It is used for independent events which occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time.
7013	One way to par- allelize neural network training is to use a technique called Network Parallel Training (NPT). In this approach the neu- rons of the ANN are divided across machines in the cluster, so that each machine holds a portion of the neural network.
7014	In general, an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (i.e., ability to diagnose patients with and without the disease or condition based on the test), 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8 to 0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstanding.

7019	Sampling bias occurs when some members of a population are systematically more likely to be selected in a sample than others. It is also called ascertainment bias in medical fields.  In other words, findings from biased samples can only be generalized to populations that share characteristics with the sample.
7020	A feature map is formed by different units in a CNN that share the same weights and biases. For example:  Basically they are feature extractors/filters learned through training.

7024	“Statistical significance helps quantify whether a result is likely due to chance or to some factor of interest,” says Redman. When a finding is significant, it simply means you can feel confident that's it real, not that you just got lucky (or unlucky) in choosing the sample.
7025	As you can see, both time-series data and cross-sectioned data are one-dimensional. We can combine time-series and cross-sectional data to form two-dimensional data sets. Observations on multiple phenomena over multiple time periods are called panel data.
7026	The short answer is yes—because most regression models will not perfectly fit the data at hand. If you need a more complex model, applying a neural network to the problem can provide much more prediction power compared to a traditional regression.
7027	A feedforward neural network is a biologically inspired classification algorithm. It consist of a (possibly large) number of simple neuron-like processing units, organized in layers.

Features are also sometimes referred to as “variables” or “attributes.” Depending on what you're trying to analyze, the features you include in your dataset can vary widely.
7035	The significance level, also denoted as alpha or α, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For example, a significance level of 0.05 indicates a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.
7036	A matrix is a linear operator acting on the vector space of column vectors. Per linear algebra and its isomorphism theorems, any vector space is isomorphic to any other vector space of the same dimension. As such, matrices can be seen as representations of linear operators subject to some basis of column vectors.

7376	In machine learning, the delta rule is a gradient descent learning rule for updating the weights of the inputs to artificial neurons in a single-layer neural network. It is a special case of the more general backpropagation algorithm.
7377	While Neural Networks use neurons to transmit data in the form of input values and output values through connections, Deep Learning is associated with the transformation and extraction of feature which attempts to establish a relationship between stimuli and associated neural responses present in the brain.
7378	The law of averages is a false belief, sometimes known as the 'gambler's fallacy,' that is derived from the law of large numbers.  The law of averages is a misconception that probability occurs with a small number of consecutive experiments so they will certainly have to 'average out' sooner rather than later.
7379	Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
7380	In machine learning and statistics, the learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
7381	First, linear regression needs the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear. It is also important to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects.  Multicollinearity occurs when the independent variables are too highly correlated with each other.
7382	ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron or later Adaptive Linear Element) is an early single-layer artificial neural network and the name of the physical device that implemented this network. The network uses memistors.  It is based on the McCulloch–Pitts neuron. It consists of a weight, a bias and a summation function.

7386	Statisticians use variance to see how individual numbers relate to each other within a data set, rather than using broader mathematical techniques such as arranging numbers into quartiles. One drawback to variance is that it gives added weight to outliers, the numbers that are far from the mean.
7387	First step: find the residuals. For each x-value in the sample, compute the fitted value or predicted value of y, using ˆyi = ˆβ0 + ˆβ1xi. Then subtract each fitted value from the corresponding actual, observed, value of yi. Squaring and summing these differences gives the SSR.

7390	The Finite Population Correction Factor (FPC) is used when you sample without replacement from more than 5% of a finite population. It's needed because under these circumstances, the Central Limit Theorem doesn't hold and the standard error of the estimate (e.g. the mean or proportion) will be too big.
7391	A Power Spectral Density (PSD) is the measure of signal's power content versus frequency.  Therefore, while the power spectrum calculates the area under the signal plot using the discrete Fourier Transform, the power spectrum density assigns units of power to each unit of frequency and thus, enhances periodicities.

7409	The Minimax algorithm helps find the best move, by working backwards from the end of the game. At each step it assumes that player A is trying to maximize the chances of A winning, while on the next turn player B is trying to minimize the chances of A winning (i.e., to maximize B's own chances of winning).
7410	The mean, median, and mode of a normal distribution are equal. The area under the normal curve is equal to 1.0. Normal distributions are denser in the center and less dense in the tails. Normal distributions are defined by two parameters, the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).
7411	"Meaning of Entropy At a conceptual level, Shannon's Entropy is simply the ""amount of information"" in a variable. More mundanely, that translates to the amount of storage (e.g. number of bits) required to store the variable, which can intuitively be understood to correspond to the amount of information in that variable."

7689	The median is usually preferred in these situations because the value of the mean can be distorted by the outliers. However, it will depend on how influential the outliers are. If they do not significantly distort the mean, using the mean as the measure of central tendency will usually be preferred.
7690	A decision boundary is the region of a problem space in which the output label of a classifier is ambiguous. If the decision surface is a hyperplane, then the classification problem is linear, and the classes are linearly separable. Decision boundaries are not always clear cut.
7691	A correlation coefficient that is greater than zero indicates a positive relationship between two variables. A value that is less than zero signifies a negative relationship between two variables. Finally, a value of zero indicates no relationship between the two variables that are being compared.

11527	RBMs were invented by Geoffrey Hinton and can be used for dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, collaborative filtering, feature learning, and topic modeling. RBMs are a special class of Boltzmann Machines and they are restricted in terms of the connections between the visible and the hidden units.
11528	Parameters are key to machine learning algorithms.  In this case, a parameter is a function argument that could have one of a range of values. In machine learning, the specific model you are using is the function and requires parameters in order to make a prediction on new data.
11529	In data parallel model, tasks are assigned to processes and each task performs similar types of operations on different data. Data parallelism is a consequence of single operations that is being applied on multiple data items. Data-parallel model can be applied on shared-address spaces and message-passing paradigms.
11530	If there is no relationship between X and Y, the best guess for all values of X is the mean of Y. At any rate, the regression line always passes through the means of X and Y. This means that, regardless of the value of the slope, when X is at its mean, so is Y.
11531	In multi-agent simulation systems the MAS is used as a model to simulate some real-world domain. Typical use is in domains involving many different components, interacting in diverse and complex ways and where the system-level properties are not readily inferred from the properties of the components.
11532	When two events are dependent events, one event influences the probability of another event. A dependent event is an event that relies on another event to happen first.
11533	Stream processing is the processing of data in motion, or in other words, computing on data directly as it is produced or received. The majority of data are born as continuous streams: sensor events, user activity on a website, financial trades, and so on – all these data are created as a series of events over time.
11534	K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.  KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.
11535	"The length of time between each transit is the planet's ""orbital period"", or the length of a year on that particular planet. Not all planets have years as long as a year on the Earth! Some planets discovered by Kepler orbit around their stars so quickly that their years only last about four hours!"
11536	Bayesian OptimizationBuild a surrogate probability model of the objective function.Find the hyperparameters that perform best on the surrogate.Apply these hyperparameters to the true objective function.Update the surrogate model incorporating the new results.Repeat steps 2–4 until max iterations or time is reached.
11537	Outlier detection is the process of detecting and subsequently excluding outliers from a given set of data. An outlier may be defined as a piece of data or observation that deviates drastically from the given norm or average of the data set.
11538	The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN. The layer's parameters consist of a set of learnable filters (or kernels), which have a small receptive field, but extend through the full depth of the input volume.
11539	Pattern recognition requires repetition of experience. Semantic memory, which is used implicitly and subconsciously is the main type of memory involved with recognition.  The development of neural networks in the outer layer of the brain in humans has allowed for better processing of visual and auditory patterns.
11540	Precision and recall at k: Definition Precision at k is the proportion of recommended items in the top-k set that are relevant. Its interpretation is as follows. Suppose that my precision at 10 in a top-10 recommendation problem is 80%. This means that 80% of the recommendation I make are relevant to the user.
11541	It is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
11542	"In machine learning, a deep belief network (DBN) is a generative graphical model, or alternatively a class of deep neural network, composed of multiple layers of latent variables (""hidden units""), with connections between the layers but not between units within each layer."
11543	A SIFT descriptor is a 3-D spatial histogram of the image gradients in characterizing the appearance of a keypoint. The gradient at each pixel is regarded as a sample of a three-dimensional elementary feature vector, formed by the pixel location and the gradient orientation.
11544	Linear Regression Analysis consists of more than just fitting a linear line through a cloud of data points. It consists of 3 stages – (1) analyzing the correlation and directionality of the data, (2) estimating the model, i.e., fitting the line, and (3) evaluating the validity and usefulness of the model.
11545	The area under the ROC curve (AUC) results were considered excellent for AUC values between 0.9-1, good for AUC values between 0.8-0.9, fair for AUC values between 0.7-0.8, poor for AUC values between 0.6-0.7 and failed for AUC values between 0.5-0.6.

11547	To calculate the total variance, you would subtract the average actual value from each of the actual values, square the results and sum them. From there, divide the first sum of errors (explained variance) by the second sum (total variance), subtract the result from one, and you have the R-squared.
11548	Bayesian inference is a machine learning model not as widely used as deep learning or regression models.
11549	Deep Q-Networks In deep Q-learning, we use a neural network to approximate the Q-value function. The state is given as the input and the Q-value of all possible actions is generated as the output.
11550	"Uninformative priors. An uninformative prior or diffuse prior expresses vague or general information about a variable. The term ""uninformative prior"" is somewhat of a misnomer. Such a prior might also be called a not very informative prior, or an objective prior, i.e. one that's not subjectively elicited."
11551	Expected Population Error Rate (EPER) is the expected rate of error in the population. The rate is usually estimated based on past operating history, previous test results, process observation or walk-through.
11552	The relationship between margin of error and sample size is simple: As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases.  If you think about it, it makes sense that the more information you have, the more accurate your results are going to be (in other words, the smaller your margin of error will get).
11553	Abstract. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a simple and effective frame- work for modelling time-varying spectral vector sequences. As a con- sequence, almost all present day large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems are based on HMMs.
11554	A discrete distribution is a statistical distribution that shows the probabilities of discrete (countable) outcomes, such as 1, 2, 3  Overall, the concepts of discrete and continuous probability distributions and the random variables they describe are the underpinnings of probability theory and statistical analysis.

11557	The easiest[A] way to evaluate the actual value of a Tensor object is to pass it to the Session. run() method, or call Tensor. eval() when you have a default session (i.e. in a with tf. Session(): block, or see below).
11558	More formally, statistical power is the probability of finding a statistically significant result, given that there really is a difference (or effect) in the population.  So, larger sample sizes give more reliable results with greater precision and power, but they also cost more time and money.

11560	The simplest approach to identifying irregularities in data is to flag the data points that deviate from common statistical properties of a distribution, including mean, median, mode, and quantiles. Let's say the definition of an anomalous data point is one that deviates by a certain standard deviation from the mean.
11561	Imbalanced data typically refers to a classification problem where the number of observations per class is not equally distributed; often you'll have a large amount of data/observations for one class (referred to as the majority class), and much fewer observations for one or more other classes (referred to as the
11562	A Classification and Regression Tree(CART) is a predictive algorithm used in machine learning. It explains how a target variable's values can be predicted based on other values. It is a decision tree where each fork is a split in a predictor variable and each node at the end has a prediction for the target variable.
11563	"Convenience sampling is a type of nonprobability sampling in which people are sampled simply because they are ""convenient"" sources of data for researchers. In probability sampling, each element in the population has a known nonzero chance of being selected through the use of a random selection procedure."
11564	Difference between K Means and Hierarchical clustering Hierarchical clustering can't handle big data well but K Means clustering can. This is because the time complexity of K Means is linear i.e. O(n) while that of hierarchical clustering is quadratic i.e. O(n2).

11566	The normal distribution is the most important probability distribution in statistics because it fits many natural phenomena. For example, heights, blood pressure, measurement error, and IQ scores follow the normal distribution. It is also known as the Gaussian distribution and the bell curve.
11567	Geometrical meaning of integration is a statement so it must be true. Another way of analysing this statement is area of a curve or the volume of a curve of revolution or area of an implicit equation of x and y.  The geometrical meaning of integration is to find the area under the corresponding curve.

11569	Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are; RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit.
11570	Why use Random Forest Algorithm Random forest algorithm can be used for both classifications and regression task. It provides higher accuracy through cross validation. Random forest classifier will handle the missing values and maintain the accuracy of a large proportion of data.
11571	Response bias is a general term for a wide range of tendencies for participants to respond inaccurately or falsely to questions. These biases are prevalent in research involving participant self-report, such as structured interviews or surveys.
11572	"The ""mean"" is the ""average"" you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The ""median"" is the ""middle"" value in the list of numbers.  If no number in the list is repeated, then there is no mode for the list."
11573	Decision tree is unstable because training a tree with a slightly different sub-sample causes the structure of the tree to change drastically. It overfits by learning from noise data as well and optimises for that particular sample, which causes its variable importance order to change significantly.
11574	Stratified sampling offers several advantages over simple random sampling. A stratified sample can provide greater precision than a simple random sample of the same size. Because it provides greater precision, a stratified sample often requires a smaller sample, which saves money.
11575	A vital aspect of the model construction process is the calibration phase.  In fact, a model's predictive uncertainty will only be reduced by calibration if the information content of the calibration data set is able to constrain those parameters that have a significant bearing on that prediction.

11578	Motivation. Since the range of values of raw data varies widely, in some machine learning algorithms, objective functions will not work properly without normalization.  Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance.
11579	The AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties.

11581	"""The difference between discrete choice models and conjoint models is that discrete choice models present experimental replications of the market with the focus on making accurate predictions regarding the market, while conjoint models do not, using product profiles to estimate underlying utilities (or partworths)"
11582	The main use of F-distribution is to test whether two independent samples have been drawn for the normal populations with the same variance, or if two independent estimates of the population variance are homogeneous or not, since it is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages.
11583	Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model.
11584	A null hypothesis is a type of conjecture used in statistics that proposes that there is no difference between certain characteristics of a population or data-generating process. The alternative hypothesis proposes that there is a difference.
11585	Statistical stationarity: A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time.  Such statistics are useful as descriptors of future behavior only if the series is stationary.
11586	A qualitative variable is a variable that expresses a quality. Values do not have numerical meaning and cannot be ordered numerically. Height, mass, age, and shoe size would all be measured in terms of numbers. So, these categories do not contain qualitative data.
11587	For example, if you have daily sales data and you expect that it exhibits annual seasonality, you should have more than 365 data points to train a successful model. If you have hourly data and you expect your data exhibits weekly seasonality, you should have more than 7*24 = 168 observations to train a model.
11588	Best! Logistic regression chooses the class that has the biggest probability. In case of 2 classes, the threshold is 0.5: if P(Y=0) > 0.5 then obviously P(Y=0) > P(Y=1). The same stands for the multiclass setting: again, it chooses the class with the biggest probability (see e.g. Ng's lectures, the bottom lines).

11591	Statistical Validity is the extent to which the conclusions drawn from a statistical test are accurate and reliable. To achieve statistical validity, researchers must have an adequate sample size and pick the right statistical test to analyze the data.
11592	"Time efficiency - a measure of amount of time for an algorithm to execute. Space efficiency - a measure of the amount of memory needed for an algorithm to execute. Asymptotic dominance - comparison of cost functions when n is large. That is, g asymptotically dominates f if g dominates f for all ""large"" values of n."
11593	To achieve the desired performance in the second case, the tuning should be repeated periodically or upon changes in controller performance, reflected in increased control variability. If this procedure is triggered and controlled automatically, the operation is called adaptive tuning.
11594	Multi-view data is common in real-world datasets, where different views describe distinct perspec- tives.  Multi-view data is prevalent in many real-world applications.

11596	Excessive dust, spider webs, and loose sensors and detectors can all be the source of false alarms.
11597	The data can be misleading due to the sampling method used to obtain data. For instance, the size and the type of sample used in any statistics play a significant role — many polls and questionnaires target certain audiences that provide specific answers, resulting in small and biased sample sizes.

11599	Definition: In simple words, data mining is defined as a process used to extract usable data from a larger set of any raw data. It implies analysing data patterns in large batches of data using one or more software.  Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD).
11600	In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the system's algorithms act on the data without prior training. The output is dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is an established way of testing the capabilities of that system.
11601	The Bayesian framework for machine learning states that you start out by enumerating all reasonable models of the data and assigning your prior belief P(M) to each of these models. Then, upon observing the data D, you evaluate how probable the data was under each of these models to compute P(D|M).
11602	Difficulties in NLU Syntax Level ambiguity − A sentence can be parsed in different ways. For example, “He lifted the beetle with red cap.” − Did he use cap to lift the beetle or he lifted a beetle that had red cap? Referential ambiguity − Referring to something using pronouns. For example, Rima went to Gauri.
11603	A sampling distribution is a probability distribution of a statistic obtained from a larger number of samples drawn from a specific population. The sampling distribution of a given population is the distribution of frequencies of a range of different outcomes that could possibly occur for a statistic of a population.
